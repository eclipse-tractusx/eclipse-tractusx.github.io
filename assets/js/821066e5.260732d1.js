The pull of customs information by using digital twins based on the industry core and push of customs information by using the standardized message-based data exchange within Catena-X.

This is a central calculation method to determine whether exported goods have the right for a preference (preference entitlement). The aim of doing a preference calculation is tariff reduction or exemption in the receiving country within the scope of free trade and preference agreements.

This certificate guarantees a recipient the origin of a product in accordance with a specific preference rule and serves as the only possible evidence for an exporter to apply for or issue a proof of preferential origin. Supplier's declarations for a single consignment of goods are also called individual supplier's declarations. Long-term supplier's declarations, on the other hand, are one-time declarations that are valid for deliveries over a longer period.

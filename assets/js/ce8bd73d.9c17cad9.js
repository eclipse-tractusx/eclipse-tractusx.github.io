In most cases, the requirements are first managed by the client in special requirements management software. As a starting point for collaboration in the product development process, one or more files for the product to be developed are extracted from the requirements management software with the requirements and possibly other information and made available to the development partner. In order for the development partner to view and evaluate the requirements, they must import the file into their requirements management tool (which may or may not be the same as the customer's).

The formats can be divided into structured and unstructured files. Unstructured files are texts, tables etc. that are not organized into individual requirements without prior processing. These increase the effort required to organize the document into individual requirements. This also makes the exchange with the partner more difficult, as the partner does not know the newly created structure. With structured files, the aforementioned circumstances no longer exist, as the requirements are already organized. In the best case, a standardized form, such as the ReqIF format, is used. However, even when using standardized formats such as ReqIF, it is still necessary to agree on a common data model for exporting and importing in advance so that data exchange via the various requirements management tools works as smoothly as possible."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.h3,{id:"benefits-for-oem-sme-and-solution-provider",children:"Benefits for OEM, SME and Solution Provider"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.h4,{id:"oem-and-large-automotive-suppliers",children:"OEM and large automotive suppliers"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.p,{children:"The Requirements Kit presents a transformative solution for OEMs and large automotive suppliers, fundamentally optimizing their requirements management processes.

I think 14 (of 41) committers were present, but only two used their voice ;) what about the others?\\n\\n=> Maybe we should talk more beforehand, about the importance of the meeting. Responsibilities and expectations of attendance.\\n\\n### Label structure\\n\\nThe labels on the features are very important for dependencies and filtering. Yes we have a lot, but we need more ;) but on the other hand we can also delete some ;)\\n\\n**Suggestions:**\\n\\n#### New needed\\n\\n- ssi\\n- data-sovereignty\\n- policy-hub\\n- policy-registry\\n- issuer-component\\n- authority-registry\\n\\n=> discussed -> create the labels\\n\\n- open-discussions (color: red)\\n- Prep-P14 -> maybe Prep-R2412 -> do we need the specific prep label?\\n- Prep-P15\\n- Standards (marks tickets which have impact on standards)\\n- Breaking Change (marks breaking change tickets)\\n\\n#### Changes needed\\n\\n- miw => rename to identity-wallet\\n\\n#### Delete (probably we need to discuss this once since a deletion has impacts\u2026)\\n\\n- kit (reason: each kit has an own label already)\\n- foss\\n- go\\n- PI12 (ideally we just inactive it to not lose it on the old tickets)\\n- Prep-P11 (ideally we just inactive it to not lose it on the old tickets)\\n- Prep-P12 (ideally we just inactive it to not lose it on the old tickets)\\n- Project management\\n- Test results\\n  \\n#### Additionally I like to suggest a clear color coding\\n\\n- All Product labels - ocean blue\\n- All Prep-Pxx label \u2013 grey\\n- All highlight labels \u2013 red\\n- All UseCase labels \u2013 green -> can we delete this?\\n- All Expert group labels - yellow\\n\\n=> HTML color code is used\\n\\n### Clean Board\\n\\nMy feeling is, we will have round about 60 features for 24.08 -> all good. Happy about it. But on the board itself we have more than 200. I understand its good to have some features in inbox/backlog... but i think the gap is to big ... and i think a lot of them could be deleted ;(\\n\\n=> discussed and decided: Friendly reminder -> after a specific amount ot time the issues are deleted automatically\\n\\n### Views an project board\\n\\nThe views (tabs) should be cleaned up) which views are still needed?\\n\\n- Feature view (issuetype `feature`) -> for Expert Groups / Committees / Developer\\n- QGate View (issuetype `realease_ac`)\\n- ???\\n\\n### Future workingmodel\\n\\nInstead of miro we could work with GitHub Project as agenda/issuetracking. e.g. [example board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/61)\\n\\n=> lets try it\\n\\n### Custom Attribute\\n\\nSince we work together e.V/Open Source it would be beneficial if we could map the features to the related expert (groups) therefore i would like to discuss a custom attribute, which holds the related committee/expertgroup (dedicated list) -> This would help to filter and also get a better feeling\\n\\n=> prepare a poc -> Tom , Stephan\\n\\n### Featurequality\\n\\nSince sometimes the quality (how is a feature described, did you clarify your dependencies, did you talk to your committer, is the time allocated) i would like to extend the feature template to guide a little bit more. For example a checklist like:\\n\\n- \\\\[ \\\\] i have talked to dependent components\\n- \\\\[ \\\\] i have talked to my committers\\n- \\\\[ \\\\] i will contribute on this features\\n- ...\\n\\n-> mention the release process via link in the template, keep the template simple\\n-> link the contribution guidelines"},{"id":"community-office-hour-2024-04-12","metadata":{"permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-04-12","source":"@site/blog-meeting-minutes/2024-04-12-community-hour.md","title":"Community Office Hour 2024-04-12","description":"Office Hour meeting minutes","date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"meeting-minutes","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/meeting-minutes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Zierer","title":"Consortia System Team Member","url":"https://github.com/hzierer","key":"harald_zierer","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"community-office-hour-2024-04-12","title":"Community Office Hour 2024-04-12","authors":["harald_zierer"],"tags":["community","meeting-minutes"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Commiter Meeting 12.04.2024","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/committer-meeting-12-04-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Security Office Hour 2024-04-11","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/security-office-hour-2024-04-11"}},"content":"## Office Hour meeting minutes\\n\\n### System team\\n\\n- Number of previous KIT versions of the home page have been [reduced](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/pull/840).

 - [Ask the community](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-security/discussions/categories/q-a) for security help via Discussions\\n  - Keep an eye out on the [Security Announcements](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-security/discussions/categories/announcements) where news \\n    about security topics are announces regularly\\n- Get in touch with the Security Team for testing with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)\\n\\n### FOSS\\n\\n- There was a new election for a project lead role for [Stephan Bauer](https://github.com/stephanbcbauer)\\n- The Eclipse Project Handbook changed the section about handling copyright headers. A year range is not longer necessary, only the year when\\n  the file was created so there is no need to keep an eye on updating the headers. It is still allowed to put year range (creation date and\\n  last modification year) in the header but they have to be separated with comma character.\\n- Please sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement when trying to contribute to the webpage. Without that it is not possible to merge commits\\n  to the main branch.\\n- \u2757 Please don\'t put any Catena-X content or resource on the website without permission.\\n\\n### Open planning / community\\n\\n- New [Open Meetings Links](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings) are listed directly on our webpage to participate and separate calendar files can be downloaded from there.\\n- Office hours will probably start a few minutes later so the people don\'t have to wait until everyone gets there.\\n- Commiters and Contributors Meeting could be a new form of communication where the committers are more involved getting some pressure off the System Team.\\n- Newjoiner rounds for basic introductions would be held every 2 weeks in a separate session.\\n\\n### Open discussion\\n\\n- [Umbrella chart](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/e2e-testing):\\n  - Currently there is a temporary solution for the Managed Identity Wallet by SAP until the [open source version](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/managed-identity-wallet) is fixed. This is a COTS\\n    application and it raises questions like how it can be integrated into an open source software stack like the umbrella chart. It is not confirmed yet\\n    whether the version from SAP can be used without a license. Currently all components can run without MIW but data exchange functionality won\'t work.\\n- Public API versioning is still an open topic where no decision has been made to create a TRG or guide the Tractus-X community to follow\\n  one versioning strategy.\\n- An alternative for MS Teams should be found as it is hard to manage for an open community (e.g. Discord)."},{"id":"community-office-hour-2024-01-19","metadata":{"permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-01-19","source":"@site/blog-meeting-minutes/2024-01-19-community-hour.md","title":"Community Office hour 2024-01-19","description":"office hour meeting minutes","date":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"meeting-minutes","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/meeting-minutes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Zierer","title":"Consortia System Team Member","url":"https://github.com/hzierer","key":"harald_zierer","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"community-office-hour-2024-01-19","title":"Community Office hour 2024-01-19","authors":["harald_zierer"],"tags":["community","meeting-minutes"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Community Office hour 2024-01-26","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-01-26"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Open Meeting blog","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/new-open-meeting-blog"}},"content":"## office hour meeting minutes\\n\\n### System team\\n- No update\\n\\n### Security team\\n- Many open cases (>10) from GitGuardian, please check you inboxes (or spam folders)\\n- A bug bounty program is in the making\\n\\n### FOSS\\n- Happy new year: Don\'t forget to update the year in your copyright headers\\n  - some corner cases will be clarified until next office hour\\n- There is a new draft [TRG 2.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-2-6) regarding dependabot usage\\n  - please update your `DEPENDENCIES` file(s) to ensure that the suggested changes are license compliant\\n\\n### Open planning / community\\n- Last open planning session went very well\\n- There\'s a new [open meetings](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings) page\\n\\n### Open discussion\\n- discussion regarding the \\"Notice for docker image\\" to be moved into a separate file.\\n  - [TRG 4.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-4/trg-4-06) will be updated to mandate a dedicated file.\\n  - Please keep in mind to update your docker build workflow to include the new file instead of the `README.md`.

We want to open-up the software development step by step and therefore warmly invite you to shape and contribute to this reference implementation!\\n\\nTo get more transparency about the status and product roadmaps of our reference implementations, we will conduct refinement and planning meetings in the Tractus-X open-source community.\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce our upcoming planning sessions for **Tractus-X**:\\n- Open Refinementsession on 19.10.2023\\n- Open Planning/Review Session on 25.10.2023\\n\\n**Here\'s your chance to be part of an exciting journey from the ground up.**\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Disclaimer\\n\\nIn the current Catena-X consortium, the various product teams have significantly shaped and defined the Catena-X data space including business use cases,\\nnetwork services, and the architecture and have released tangible results such as standards, KITs and open-source reference implementations. The results are now to be handed over to the Catena-X association.\\n\\nWith the transition to an association, a new working model including (open) refinement and (open) plannings for PI11 must be implemented in order to further develop these results and to carry out the knowledge\\ntransfer step by step by joint teams consisting of new association members and experienced consortium members under the governance of the Catena-X association.\\n\\nThe open planning days are the first step in this direction, but not all products are ready right now for an open planning. It might be the case, that some of the features are still defined within the jira, which is provided by the consortia.\\nIn this case not all of the participants can access the features with jira.\\n\\n_Please note_ In case there is a need to update an issue (e.g. adapt the description or link a subissue as a tasklist) committer rights are needed, or the initial creator of the issue has to do the changes.\\n\\nThese first alignment sessions will not be an introductory session - you should already be familiar with the source code of the service. We will introduce other formats to make sure you get onboarded and your voice is heard if you are new. We appreciate your understanding!\\nOur committers would highly appreciate contributions as a continuous stream of smaller, more manageable changes, rather than a big all-is-done chunk at the end of development. Thank you!\\n\\n### Why Should You Attend?\\n\\n- **Share your planned contributions** and discuss them openly with contributers, fellow developers and reference solution product owners.\\n- **Collaborate** with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts.\\n- **Inform** yourself about the latest developments in the open-source community.\\n- **Share** your expertise and insights to shape the future of Tractus-X.\\n- **Learn** about the core objectives and see how you can contribute.\\n- **Connect** with the Tractus-X community and build your network.\\n\\n### Some links to get you started\\n\\n- Getting started with [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://stephanbcbauer.github.io/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/getting-started)\\n- [Eclipse Tractus-X **GitHub** getting started](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/wiki/Eclipse-Tractus-X-GitHub-getting-started)\\n- [Planning](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/blob/main/README.md) with the sig-release repositorry\\n- Feature [planning board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26) (without product filter)\\n- Current available [labels](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/labels)\\n- [Matrix Chat from Eclipse Tractus-X](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#tools.tractus-x:matrix.eclipse.org) and [getting-started](https://chat.eclipse.org/docs/getting-started/)\\n- [sig-release planning board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26) and created features on [sig-release repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues)\\n\\n### Open Refinement Session on 19.10.2023\\n\\nJoin us for our **Open Refinement Session**, where we\'ll embark on a high-level exploration of our project\'s features and outstanding issues.

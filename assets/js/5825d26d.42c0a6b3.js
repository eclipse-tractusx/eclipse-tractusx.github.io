Capabilities include knowledge about the factories, e.g., machinery, human expertise, past production outputs and processes, capability terms like \u201Cband sawing\u201D, certifications, etc. Buyers are further able to search for the manufacturing capabilities they require to produce a certain product (usually parts or assemblies). This can include individual manufacturing steps to cover missing capabilities in regard to existing productions or even fully external production offers. Both the ODM platform and the marketplace can perform the necessary matchmaking between required and offered capabilities. Usually, the ODM platforms offer the production of a certain part and often act as manufacturers, whereas the marketplace only offers the production by an arbitrary number of manufacturers. However, both may use additional IT or engineering services to provide their customers with added values such as feasibility analysis or optimization for cost reduction. Moreover, marketplaces can build hierarchies within themselves or with ODM platforms. This is the case in Catena-X, where a marketplace not only offers manufacturing capabilities registered directly by the manufacturers, but also capabilities registered with ODM platforms. In consequence, a network of networks is built which connects different networks of manufacturers (according to their capabilities) and offers multiple layers of monetarization and added value.

It is not confirmed yet\\n    whether the version from SAP can be used without a license. Currently all components can run without MIW but data exchange functionality won\'t work.\\n- Public API versioning is still an open topic where no decision has been made to create a TRG or guide the Tractus-X community to follow\\n  one versioning strategy.\\n- An alternative for MS Teams should be found as it is hard to manage for an open community (e.g. Discord)."},{"id":"office-hour-19-01-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/office-hour-19-01-2024","source":"@site/blog-meeting-minutes/2024-01-19-office-hour.md","title":"Office hour 19.01.2024","description":"office hour meeting minutes","date":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 19, 2024","tags":[{"label":"meeting-minutes","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/meeting-minutes"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/community"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Zierer","title":"Consortia System Team Member","url":"https://github.com/hzierer","key":"harald_zierer"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"office-hour-19-01-2024","title":"Office hour 19.01.2024","authors":["harald_zierer"],"tags":["meeting-minutes","community"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Office hour 26.01.2024","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/office-hour-26-01-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Open Meeting blog","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/new-open-meeting-blog"}},"content":"## office hour meeting minutes\\n\\n### System team\\n- No update\\n\\n### Security team\\n- Many open cases (>10) from GitGuardian, please check you inboxes (or spam folders)\\n- A bug bounty program is in the making\\n\\n### FOSS\\n- Happy new year: Don\'t forget to update the year in your copyright headers\\n  - some corner cases will be clarified until next office hour\\n- There is a new draft [TRG 2.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-2-6) regarding dependabot usage\\n  - please update your `DEPENDENCIES` file(s) to ensure that the suggested changes are license compliant\\n\\n### Open planning / community\\n- Last open planning session went very well\\n- There\'s a new [open meetings](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings) page\\n\\n### Open discussion\\n- discussion regarding the \\"Notice for docker image\\" to be moved into a separate file.\\n  - [TRG 4.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-4/trg-4-06) will be updated to mandate a dedicated file.\\n  - Please keep in mind to update your docker build workflow to include the new file instead of the `README.md`.

This is also the case if the serialized part / batch is no longer functional, but the missing functionality\n(a) can be compensated by other parts of a superordinate system or (b) has a relatively low significance / benefit\n\n- CRITICAL This is the case if the quality issue(s) is/are so critical that the basic functionality of the serialized parts/batch is no longer given.\n\n- LIFE-THREATENING This is the case if the quality issue(s) is/are so critical that it even endangers human lives e.g., the airbag or break is not working.",schemaName:"string",qualifierMessage:"**Possible values:** [`MINOR`, `MAJOR`, `CRITICAL`, `LIFE-THREATENING`]",defaultValue:void 0,mdxType:"SchemaItem"}),(0,n.kt)(r.Z,{collapsible:!1,name:"information",required:!1,deprecated:void 0,schemaDescription:"A text that e.g. describes the quality alert or the quality investigation.

Team for testing with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)\\n\\n### FOSS\\n\\n- There was a new election for a project lead role for [Stephan Bauer](https://github.com/stephanbcbauer)\\n- The Eclipse Project Handbook changed the section about handling copyright headers. A year range is not longer necessary, only the year when\\n  the file was created so there is no need to keep an eye on updating the headers. It is still allowed to put year range (creation date and\\n  last modification year) in the header but they have to be separated with comma character.\\n- Please sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement when trying to contribute to the webpage.

This is a COTS\\n    application and it raises questions like how it can be integrated into an open source software stack like the umbrella chart. It is not confirmed yet\\n    whether the version from SAP can be used without a license. Currently all components can run without MIW but data exchange functionality won\'t work.\\n- Public API versioning is still an open topic where no decision has been made to create a TRG or guide the Tractus-X community to follow\\n  one versioning strategy.\\n- An alternative for MS Teams should be found as it is hard to manage for an open community (e.g. Discord)."},{"id":"office-hour-19-01-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/office-hour-19-01-2024","source":"@site/blog-meeting-minutes/2024-01-19-office-hour.md","title":"Office hour 19.01.2024","description":"office hour meeting minutes","date":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 19, 2024","tags":[{"label":"tractus-x-office-hour","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/tractus-x-office-hour"},{"label":"meeting-minutes","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/meeting-minutes"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/community"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Zierer","title":"Consortia System Team Member","url":"https://github.com/hzierer","key":"harald_zierer"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"office-hour-19-01-2024","title":"Office hour 19.01.2024","authors":["harald_zierer"],"tags":["tractus-x-office-hour","meeting-minutes","community"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Office hour 26.01.2024","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/office-hour-26-01-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Open Meeting blog","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/new-open-meeting-blog"}},"content":"## office hour meeting minutes\\n\\n### System team\\n- No update\\n\\n### Security team\\n- Many open cases (>10) from GitGuardian, please check you inboxes (or spam folders)\\n- A bug bounty program is in the making\\n\\n### FOSS\\n- Happy new year: Don\'t forget to update the year in your copyright headers\\n  - some corner cases will be clarified until next office hour\\n- There is a new draft [TRG 2.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-2-6) regarding dependabot usage\\n  - please update your `DEPENDENCIES` file(s) to ensure that the suggested changes are license compliant\\n\\n### Open planning / community\\n- Last open planning session went very well\\n- There\'s a new [open meetings](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings) page\\n\\n### Open discussion\\n- discussion regarding the \\"Notice for docker image\\" to be moved into a separate file.\\n  - [TRG 4.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-4/trg-4-06) will be updated to mandate a dedicated file.\\n  - Please keep in mind to update your docker build workflow to include the new file instead of the `README.md`.

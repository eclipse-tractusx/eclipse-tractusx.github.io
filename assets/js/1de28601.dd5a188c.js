Concerns were raised about the need for additional planned team resources for triaging these issues, and it was suggested that the TRG should be finalized and teams made aware.\\n- What are best-practices for scheduling security tools Action workflows, with every PR or another frequency?\\n  - The TRG claims at least once, this is mandatory baseline for all.\\n  - Best practice is more frequently, recommendations differ per tool (e.g. secret scanning for every PR, dependency scan on a weekly basis).\\n  - The trigger will be on push + on pull + scheduled - frequency depends on repositories activity, so the team has to decide.\\n  - Best practice recommendations will be published in the sig-security repository."},{"id":"community-office-hour-2024-02-23","metadata":{"permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-02-23","source":"@site/blog-meeting-minutes/2024-02-23-community-hour.md","title":"Community Office Hour 2024-02-23","description":"Office Hour meeting minutes","date":"2024-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 23, 2024","tags":[{"label":"community","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/community"},{"label":"meeting-minutes","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/meeting-minutes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Bezold","title":"Consortia System Team Member","url":"https://github.com/SebastianBezold","imageURL":"https://github.com/SebastianBezold.png","key":"sebastian_bezold"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"community-office-hour-2024-02-23","title":"Community Office Hour 2024-02-23","authors":["sebastian_bezold"],"tags":["community","meeting-minutes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Security Office Hour 2024-02-29","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/security-office-hour-2024-02-29"},"nextItem":{"title":"Community Office Hour 2024-02-16","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-02-16"}},"content":"## Office Hour meeting minutes\\n\\n### System team\\n\\n- Quality Gate Reviews in progress.

This is a COTS\\n    application and it raises questions like how it can be integrated into an open source software stack like the umbrella chart. It is not confirmed yet\\n    whether the version from SAP can be used without a license. Currently all components can run without MIW but data exchange functionality won\'t work.\\n- Public API versioning is still an open topic where no decision has been made to create a TRG or guide the Tractus-X community to follow\\n  one versioning strategy.\\n- An alternative for MS Teams should be found as it is hard to manage for an open community (e.g. Discord)."},{"id":"community-office-hour-2024-01-19","metadata":{"permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-01-19","source":"@site/blog-meeting-minutes/2024-01-19-community-hour.md","title":"Community Office hour 2024-01-19","description":"office hour meeting minutes","date":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 19, 2024","tags":[{"label":"community","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/community"},{"label":"meeting-minutes","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/tags/meeting-minutes"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Zierer","title":"Consortia System Team Member","url":"https://github.com/hzierer","key":"harald_zierer"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"community-office-hour-2024-01-19","title":"Community Office hour 2024-01-19","authors":["harald_zierer"],"tags":["community","meeting-minutes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Community Office hour 2024-01-26","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/community-office-hour-2024-01-26"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Open Meeting blog","permalink":"/community/meeting-minutes/new-open-meeting-blog"}},"content":"## office hour meeting minutes\\n\\n### System team\\n- No update\\n\\n### Security team\\n- Many open cases (>10) from GitGuardian, please check you inboxes (or spam folders)\\n- A bug bounty program is in the making\\n\\n### FOSS\\n- Happy new year: Don\'t forget to update the year in your copyright headers\\n  - some corner cases will be clarified until next office hour\\n- There is a new draft [TRG 2.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-2-6) regarding dependabot usage\\n  - please update your `DEPENDENCIES` file(s) to ensure that the suggested changes are license compliant\\n\\n### Open planning / community\\n- Last open planning session went very well\\n- There\'s a new [open meetings](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings) page\\n\\n### Open discussion\\n- discussion regarding the \\"Notice for docker image\\" to be moved into a separate file.\\n  - [TRG 4.06](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-4/trg-4-06) will be updated to mandate a dedicated file.\\n  - Please keep in mind to update your docker build workflow to include the new file instead of the `README.md`.

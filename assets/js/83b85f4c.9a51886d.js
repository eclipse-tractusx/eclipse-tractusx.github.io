Capabilities can include knowledge of the factories, e.g., machinery, employee expertise, past production outputs and processes, capability terms like \u201Cband sawing\u201D, certifications, etc. Buyers search for the manufacturing capabilities they need to produce a specific product (usually parts or assemblies). This can include individual manufacturing steps to cover missing capabilities related to existing productions or even fully external production offers. Both the ODM platform and the marketplace can perform the necessary matchmaking between required and offered capabilities. Typically, the ODM platforms offer the production of a specific part and often act as manufacturers, whereas the marketplace only offers the production by an arbitrary number of manufacturers. However, both may utilize additional IT or engineering services to provide their customers with added values such as onboarding application, automated process derivation or sustainability services. A federated marketplace not only offers manufacturing capabilities registered directly by the manufacturers, but also capabilities registered with ODM platforms.

Furthermore, since they have the domain-expertise regarding their capabilities, they refine them, which from their point of view is similar to search engine optimization. For all that, they can use services provided by the digital ecosystem (cf. Service Provision and Consumption). Stakeholders with a demand for manufacturing capabilities can further use services to communicate this demand to the systems which perform the matchmaking. Additionally, if the demand is not yet available as process alternatives or similar machine-interpretable structures, it has to be transformed accordingly.

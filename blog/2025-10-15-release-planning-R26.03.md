## Alignment Day for R26.03

The Alignment Day focuses on addressing open questions and unresolved dependencies from features planned for Release 26.03. This means we are highly
dependent on your questions. We want to align and get a better understanding about the related features. This meeting is a possibility to connect.

:::tip

Even if you don't have questions, it could be interesting anyway.

The planning sessions will be driven by our [Release Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/43?filterQuery=-status%3ADone+has%3Atopic%2Fproduct+label%3A%22Prep-R26.03%22+status%3ABacklog), which organizes
features based on their `Topic/Product` field. The current agenda is only an example and will be updated with the actual features that are planned for **R26.03**.

### Prerequisites for features to be considered in Open Planning

For a feature to be included in the Open Planning, the following conditions must be met:

- Status must be `Backlog – Committers and Expert Groups can set this status after the feature is fully refined.
- All categories in the feature template must be filled – Do not delete any sections from the template.
- Milestone is NOT set – This will be assigned during the Open Planning session.
- Contributor and Committer must be assigned.
- Topic/Product must be set.

During the session, if there is a common alignment among the participants, the feature milestone can be set to 26.03, meaning it will be developed in the upcoming release.

### Important Notes and Hints

- Keep the board clean – there are still features with older milestones that have not yet been completed.
- Do not delete any sections from the feature template, except for KITs.
- For KITs, only the Contributor, Committer, and Description fields need to be filled.

For any questions or further information, feel free to reach out via our [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) or join us in the Tractus-X [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#automotive.tractusx:matrix.eclipse.org).

We look forward to your participation and collaboration! 🚀

Oliver Ganser talks what can be learned about digital, sustainable, and resilient corporate development through Catena-X. He also mentions Tractus-X and specifically our KITs.

Thats why we tried to translate this part for the community:


"The centerpiece of the data space are the so-called „KIT"-blocks ("Keep it together": https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/ ). KITs are the booster elements for every use case, providing an ecosystem with countless solution providers for a problem: collaborative, interoperable, and sovereign in their offerings. The necessary standards, data models, legal frameworks, installation scripts, etc. for the development of industrial solutions are summarized in the "KITs" and made available to all partners via open source."

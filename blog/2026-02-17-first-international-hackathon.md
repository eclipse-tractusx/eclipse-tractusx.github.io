## 🧩 Hackathon Challenges

We will be offering challenges to support our community goals for the next Tractus-X release in March (26.03).

### 🔐 Main Challenge: Tractus-X Identity Hub Wallet

Further develop the Tractus-X Identity Hub Wallet and integrate it into the TX Umbrella.

**This will allow us to:**
- ✅ Eliminate the need for a mocked wallet in the umbrella (by having a real open-source wallet)
- 🔄 Offer an end-to-end exchange scenario for developing better applications
- 🌐 Enhance decentralization within the Tractus-X open-source dataspace technologies

**🔗 Repositories:**
- [Identity Hub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-identityhub)
- [Umbrella](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-umbrella)

### 🏭 Secondary Challenge: Industry Core Hub Add-On

*(If time permits or with many participants)*

Integrate the PCF use case (or another add-on) into the Industry Core Hub.

**🎯 Goal:**
Enable another add-on in the Industry Core Hub and learn:
- How the IC-Hub can serve as a base for multiple use cases
- How to develop your own add-on module

**🔗 Repository:**
- [Industry Core Hub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/industry-core-hub)

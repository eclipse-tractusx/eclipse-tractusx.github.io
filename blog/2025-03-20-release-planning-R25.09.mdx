## Refinement Day 1 for R25.09

The first Refinement Day sets the foundation for R25.09. Expert groups will brainstorm, refine features, and identify key dependencies for roadmap alignment.

- **Date:** Wednesday, 09th April 2025
- **Time:** 09:05 - 12:00
- **Main Teams Link:** [Join the session](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MzU2MzUxZmItZWYxMy00YWI5LThiZmUtZTVmYzhkMTZlMzk3%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221ad22c6d-2f08-4f05-a0ba-e17f6ce88380%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22a8b7a5ee-66ff-4695-afa2-08f893d8aaf6%22%7d)

### Agenda

- **09:05 - 09:30**: Welcome, Introduction, and Expectations
- **09:30 - 11:15**: Refinement in dedicated groups
- **11:15 - 11:45**: Group presentations on progress
- **11:45 - 12:00**: Closing and Next Steps

### Sessions

:::note

Links to the teams sessions for each group will be provided soon. PLease also have a look in the [Release Management](https://matrix.to/#/#tractusx-release-planning:matrix.eclipse.org) channel and on the
[tractusx-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) mailing list.

The sessions are used for refinement day 1 and 2.

:::

### Preparation Checklist

- Review the [feature template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md).
- Prepare initial ideas for features.
- Identify potential dependencies with other groups or components.
- Familiarize yourself with related roadmap items.
- Use the supported-by field to map the feature with your expert group

### Group and Teams Sessions

During the refinement sessions, each group will focus on the first steps of skeleton-building for their features (based on the [feature template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md)),
mapping them to the related roadmap items. Donâ€™t worry about completing every section of the feature template just yet â€” this is a time for brainstorming and forming initial ideas.

It's essential, however, to use the **feature template** and identify **dependencies** with other components or groups, which will help us add the correct labels to the features.
Youâ€™re encouraged to collaborate across groups as needed, and weâ€™ll provide **Teams sessions** for each group to work in.

:::tip
The sessions for the different groups / components / dependencies can be used to sync within the underlying expert groups. Feel free to switch between groups if necessary!
:::

## Alignment Day for R25.09

The Alignment Day replaces the previously planned Refinement Day 2. It focuses on addressing **open questions** and unresolved **dependencies** from features planned for Release 25.09. Participation is only required if you have open topics to discuss.

- **Date:** Wednesday, 30th April 2025  
- **Time:** 09:05 - 12:00  
- **Main Teams Link:** [Join the session](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YzhlNTU3ZTYtYTA4Ni00NWFhLTgxMDMtMWFmYTRkYmVkZWNj%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221ad22c6d-2f08-4f05-a0ba-e17f6ce88380%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22a8b7a5ee-66ff-4695-afa2-08f893d8aaf6%22%7d)

## Agenda

:::info
The agenda itself is dependent on the labled features.
:::

- 09:05 - 09:30: Welcome and overview of `Open Discussion` features  
- 09:30 - 11:30: Group discussions and breakout sessions as needed  
- 11:30 - 12:00: Optional closing and documentation of decisions

## Key Focus Areas

- Only features labeled `Open Discussion` will be considered for the agenda.  
- The label must be added at least 3 days prior to the event.  
- This is not a planning or refinement session â€” itâ€™s a space to align on open questions and clarify remaining uncertainties.  
- Feature owners should be ready to describe their needs or concerns.  
- Component developers can use this session to clarify what is expected from them.  

### Group and Teams Sessions

Due to the fact, that we are working along an agenda, there will be no group sessions.

## Open Planning for R25.09

The Open Planning session finalizes the roadmap for R25.09, prioritizing features and aligning all participants on deliverables for the release.

- **Date:** Wednesday, 7th May 2025
- **Time:** 09:05 - 17:00
- **Teams Link:** [Join the session](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NjkzMmM3ZmYtNTA4Zi00MGIyLTk0YWYtODg2OWM1N2E2YTg0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221ad22c6d-2f08-4f05-a0ba-e17f6ce88380%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225365a192-079b-4140-947d-d47db343e981%22%7d)

**Who Should Attend**:
- Contributors and Committers from the open-source community
- Expert Group and Committee members
- Feature requesters and stakeholders

:::note
Your participation is crucial to ensure the success of the release planning. Expert Groups, Committees, the open-source community (contributor and committer),
feature requesters are encouraged to attend and actively engage in the discussions.
:::

### Agenda

Hereâ€™s the plan for the day:
- **09:05 - 09:30**: Open Planning - Vision & Introduction
- **09:30 - 16:00**: Joint Open Planning (all teams)
- **16:00 - 16:30**: Feedback Retro
- **16:30 - 17:00**: Open Planning Wrap-Up / Summary & Next Steps

The planning sessions will be driven by our [Release Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/28?filterQuery=-status%3ADone+has%3Asupported-by+label%3A%22Prep-R25.09%22+status%3ABacklog), which organizes features based on their **supported-by** field.

### Prerequisites for features to be considered in Open Planning

For a feature to be included in the Open Planning, the following conditions must be met:
- **Status must be 'Backlog'** â€“ Committers and Expert Groups can set this status after the feature is fully refined.
- **All categories in the feature template must be filled** â€“ Do not delete any sections from the template.
- **Milestone is NOT set** â€“ This will be assigned during the Open Planning session.
- **Contributor and Committer must be assigned**.
- **Supported-by must be set**.

During the session, if there is a common alignment among the participants, the feature milestone can be set to **25.09**, meaning it will be developed in the upcoming release.

### Important Notes and Hints

- Keep the board clean â€“ there are still features with older milestones that have not yet been completed.
- Do not delete any sections from the feature template, except for KITs.
- For KITs, only the Contributor, Committer, and Description fields need to be filled.

For any questions or further information, feel free to reach out via our [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) or join us in the Tractus-X [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#automotive.tractusx:matrix.eclipse.org).

We look forward to your participation and collaboration! ðŸš€

## Alignment Day for R25.12

The Alignment Day focuses on addressing **open questions** and unresolved **dependencies** from features planned for Release 25.12. This means we are highly dependent on your questions.
We want to align and get a better understanding about the related features. This meeting is a possibility to connect. Even if you don't have questions, it could be interesting anyway.

- **Date:** 31.07.2025
- **Time:** 09:05 - 12:00
- **Main Teams Link:** [Join the session](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODg5N2NlY2QtNzc2My00ZGJkLWIxNzMtNTFmZGQwZTc2NzU2%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221ad22c6d-2f08-4f05-a0ba-e17f6ce88380%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22c4f4cd17-5452-4057-9b00-42444990d814%22%7d)

### Agenda

The agenda itself is dependent on the labeled features.

- Component developers can use this session to clarify what is expected from them.

### Prerequisites for features to be considered in Open Planning

For a feature to be included in the Open Planning, the following conditions must be met:
- **Status must be 'Backlog'** – Committers and Expert Groups can set this status after the feature is fully refined.
- **All categories in the feature template must be filled** – Do not delete any sections from the template.
- **Milestone is NOT set** – This will be assigned during the Open Planning session.
- **Contributor and Committer must be assigned**.
- **`Topic/Product` must be set**.

During the session, if there is a common alignment among the participants, the feature milestone can be set to **25.12**, meaning it will be developed in the upcoming release.

### Important Notes and Hints

- Keep the board clean – there are still features with older milestones that have not yet been completed.
- Do not delete any sections from the feature template, except for KITs.
- For KITs, only the Contributor, Committer, and Description fields need to be filled.

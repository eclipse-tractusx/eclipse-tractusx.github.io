### Prerequisites for features to be considered in Open Planning

For a feature to be included in the Open Planning, the following conditions must be met:

- Status must be `Backlog` – Committers and Expert Groups can set this status after the feature is fully refined.
- All categories in the feature template must be filled – Do not delete any sections from the template.
- Milestone is NOT set – This will be assigned during the Open Planning session.
- Contributor and Committer must be assigned.
- Topic/Product must be set.

During the session, if there is a common alignment among the participants, the feature milestone can be set to 26.06, meaning it will be developed in the upcoming release.

### Important Notes and Hints

- Keep the board clean – there are still features with older milestones that have not yet been completed.
- Do not delete any sections from the feature template, except for KITs.
- For KITs, only the Contributor, Committer, and Description fields need to be filled.

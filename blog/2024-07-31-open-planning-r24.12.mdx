### Refinement Phase - Release 24.12

Please be aware that the Refinement Phase is to keep you aware of the overall timeline during the Release Process and does not constitute an actual meeting. It serves informational
purposes only. During this time, the necessary people/groups should come together and work (refine) the future features. Feature authors take care of organising appointments and
communicating with the relevant contacts themselves. The Teams Session link can be used. Be aware: The link and the shared content is available to everyone.

- *Monday, 24. June 2024 to Sunday, 28. July 2024 (CEST)*
- [open meeting](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings/#Refinement%20Phase%20-%20Release%2024.12)

### Refinement Day 1 - Release 24.12

This event is organised and moderated by the Catena-X Association. Based on a predefined agenda (depending on the features on the board), individual dependencies are discussed and
also documented directly on the feature. If the refinement of the features has already been carried out 'in the refinement phase' and the Definition of Entry (DoE) has already reached,
this meeting can also be used as synchronisation.

### Draft Feature Freeze - Release 24.12

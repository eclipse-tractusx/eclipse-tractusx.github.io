## Join the release event for Catena-X Release 24.03

**Join us live instead of just being informed - we invite you to the first live event of a Catena-X release on 15 March in the ARENA2036!**

### Get to know the Catena-X Releases

<!--truncate-->

**The next Catena-X Release 24.03 will be published in march 2024.** Catena-X e.V. invites you to this event at ARENA2036 in Stuttgart. For the first time,
application developers and other interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about the extended range of functions and the associated new application
options in person and at first hand as part of a Catena-X Release. Networking, demos, interaction and assistance for concrete participation in the data ecosystem included!

This is a hybrid event consisting of a conference part followed by a get-together with the experts. You can take part in the conference part either on site or virtually.
The conference part includes:

- Information on the last releases 23.12 and 24.03 as well as an outlook on the next major release 24.05
- Presentation of the future release process
- Options for participation in the ecosystem and certification conditions
- Success stories from participants of the live ecosystem

The **agenda** will follow shortly.

If you are an application developer or product manager in the Catena-X environment or would like to meet developers or experts from Catena-X in person to discuss this release,
you should attend the event.

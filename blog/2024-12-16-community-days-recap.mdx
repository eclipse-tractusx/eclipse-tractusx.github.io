Dear Tractus-X- and Dataspace-Community,

The Third Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days, held on December 5 and 6, 2024, at ARENA2036 in Stuttgart, marked a significant milestone in our journey towards fostering
open-source collaboration within the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Building upon the successes of previous events, this edition attracted over 220 participants
from diverse regions, including Japan, Spain, the USA, and India, underscoring the growing global interest in the Tractus-X initiative.

A notable highlight was the increased participation from representatives of Manufacturing-X projects such as Factory-X, Aerospace-X, Semiconductor-X, Chem-X, and Construction-X.
Their involvement enriched the discussions with fresh perspectives, fostering a broader ecosystem for networking and collaborative development.

This year's event introduced an updated format tailored to various interests and experience levels, featuring multiple streams, presentations, workshops and challenges.
This setup provided a comprehensive Tractus-X environment with federated services and use cases, enhancing the hands-on experience for attendees.

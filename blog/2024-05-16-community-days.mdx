Dear Tractus-X- and Dataspace-Community,

**After the great success of our event in December 2023, we are pleased to invite you to the second edition: the Second Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days on May 16 and 17, 2024,
again in the inspiring and collaborative atmosphere of ARENA2036 in Stuttgart!**

<!--truncate-->

### Why you should be there

At the follow-up event, we will once again offer you the opportunity to meet the developer community live, actively engage with our Tractus-X IT tools and exchange ideas with technical
experts. Gain deep insights into open-source reference implementations and KITs in the Tractus-X project as well as into the technology of sovereign data exchange and actively contribute
your ideas in practical hands-on workshops (e.g. for use cases).

### What you can expect

You can look forward to keynote speeches with highly interesting insights, short deep dives for a practical introduction to open-source topics and, in the main, workshops and hands-on sessions
in which you can get active and code on Tractus-X yourself with our support.

Once again, a community party awaits you on the first evening for networking and talking shop with delicious food and an entertaining program.

The Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days start on Thursday at 12 noon and end on Friday at around 4 p.m.

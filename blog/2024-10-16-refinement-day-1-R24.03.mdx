Hello, Tractus-X Community!

Weâ€™re excited to announce **Refinement Day 1**, taking place on **October 16th, from 09:05 to 12:00**. This event is focused on refining features for the
upcoming **Release 25.03**. Unlike previous meetings, this won't just be a feature presentation day â€” weâ€™ll be diving into hands-on work, helping each other
refine features and identify dependencies.

The blocker and overall teams session link can be found on our [open-meetings](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings#Refinement%20Day%201%20-%20Release%2025.03) page. We look forward to seeing you all there!

## Agenda for Refinement Day 1

Hereâ€™s the plan for the day:
- **09:05 - 09:30**: Welcome, Introduction, and Expectations
- **09:30 - 11:15**: Refinement in dedicated groups, grouped by expert groups
- **11:15 - 11:45**: Presenting the results, grouped by expert groups
- **11:45 - 12:00**: Closing and Next Steps

During the refinement sessions, each group will focus on the first steps of skeleton-building for their features (based on the [feature template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md),
mapping them to the related roadmap items. Donâ€™t worry about completing every section of the feature template just yet â€” this is a time for brainstorming and forming initial ideas.

It's essential, however, to use the **feature template** and identify **dependencies** with other components or groups, which will help us add the correct labels to the features.
Youâ€™re encouraged to collaborate across groups as needed, and weâ€™ll provide **Teams sessions** for each group to work in.

## Group Work & Presenting Results

The goal of the refinement is to **identify the first ideas and dependencies** within your group. The **General Teams session** will be available for any questions that come up during this collaborative work.

At the end of the refinement session, weâ€™ll regroup and present the progress made. Each expert group will present their refined features, focusing on whatâ€™s been developed so far and the key insights.

### Example Groups and Teams Sessions:
- **Expert Group 1**: [Teams Session Link](#)
- **Expert Group 2**: [Teams Session Link](#)
- **Expert Group 3**: [Teams Session Link](#)

Feel free to switch between groups if necessary!

### Special Note for KITs

For KITs, we understand that not all sections of the template are necessary right now. The most important things to include at this stage are:
- The **Feature Team** responsible for the work
- A brief **explanation of the feature** (just 2 sentences)

## Next Steps & Refinement Day 2

By the end of the session, we expect to have features that may not be fully refined but will be in good shape for further refinement or proactive work on dependencies. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity
to connect with other groups and components that youâ€™re dependent on.

As we look ahead to **[Refinement Day 2](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings#Refinement%20Day%202%20-%20Release%2025.03)**, our focus will shift towards **dependency components**. It will be crucial to have those dependencies properly tagged with labels on the features.

We look forward to a productive Refinement Day - Happy Refining! ðŸš€

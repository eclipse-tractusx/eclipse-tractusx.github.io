### Looking Back at Past Community Days

Our journey began with the **first Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days** in December 2023, bringing together an enthusiastic community of innovators and developers. We followed up with the **second
 edition** in May 2024, featuring hands-on workshops, insightful keynotes, and an engaging networking party. Each event left participants energized, inspired, and equipped with valuable skills.

This December, we’re continuing the tradition with more exciting content and new ways to connect with the community. The **Third Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days** promises to be the biggest and best yet ;)

We can’t wait to welcome you to the **Third Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days**. Be part of the future of open-source collaboration and innovation!

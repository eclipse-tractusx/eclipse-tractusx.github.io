This December, we’re continuing the tradition with more exciting content and new ways to connect with the community. The **Third Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days** promises to be the biggest and best yet ;)

We can’t wait to welcome you to the **Third Eclipse Tractus-X Community Days**. Be part of the future of open-source collaboration and innovation!

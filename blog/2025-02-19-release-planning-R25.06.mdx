Hello, Eclipse Tractus-X Community!

We are thrilled to invite you to a series of important sessions designed to drive collaboration, alignment, and planning for Eclipse Tractus-X Release R25.06.
These meetings are essential to ensure a well-structured and successful release. Mark your calendars and come prepared to contribute!

The overall teams session link and more links can be found on our [open-meetings](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/open-meetings#one-time-meetings) page.

We look forward to seeing you all there!!!

## Refinement Day 1 for R25.06

During the refinement sessions, each group will focus on the first steps of skeleton-building for their features ( based on the [feature template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md) ),
mapping them to the related roadmap items. Don’t worry about completing every section of the feature template just yet — this is a time for brainstorming and forming initial ideas.

It's essential, however, to use the **feature template** and identify **dependencies** with other components or groups, which will help us add the correct labels to the features.
You’re encouraged to collaborate across groups as needed, and we’ll provide **Teams sessions** for each group to work in.

- **Date:** Wednesday, 22nd January 2025
- **Time:** 09:05 - 12:00
- **Main Teams Link:** [Join the session](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODVmYWM1OGYtNjdkYS00ODgxLWI1YWEtMjAwZGJjY2NjNGIw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221ad22c6d-2f08-4f05-a0ba-e17f6ce88380%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22a8b7a5ee-66ff-4695-afa2-08f893d8aaf6%22%7d)

### Agenda

Here’s the plan for the day:
- **09:05 - 09:30**: Welcome, Introduction, and Expectations
- **09:30 - 11:15**: Refinement in dedicated groups, grouped by expert groups
- **11:15 - 11:45**: Presenting the results, grouped by expert groups
- **11:45 - 12:00**: Closing and Next Steps

During the refinement sessions, each group will focus on the first steps of skeleton-building for their features (based on the [feature template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md),
mapping them to the related roadmap items. Don’t worry about completing every section of the feature template just yet — this is a time for brainstorming and forming initial ideas.

It's essential, however, to use the **feature template** and identify **dependencies** with other components or groups, which will help us add the correct labels to the features.
You’re encouraged to collaborate across groups as needed, and we’ll provide **Teams sessions** for each group to work in.

### Group Work & Presenting Results

The goal of the refinement is to **identify the first ideas and dependencies** within your group. The **General Teams session** will be available for any questions that come up during this collaborative work.

Important for the session:
- Use the [feature template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md) to structure your work
- Identify dependencies with other components or groups and add the correct labels to the features
- Use the supported-by field to map the feature with your expert group

At the end of the refinement session, we’ll regroup and present the progress made. Each expert group will present their refined features, focusing on what’s been developed so far and the key insights.

### Group and Teams Sessions

:::tip
The sessions for the different groups / components / dependencies can be used to sync within the underlying expert groups. Feel free to switch between groups if necessary!

## Refinement Day 2 for R25.06

During the refinement sessions, each group will focus on resolving **identified dependencies** from Refinement Day 1, which are visible via the **related labels** on the features.
While further feature refinement is allowed, the emphasis is on addressing and coordinating **dependencies** between groups and components.

Our working Board for the day is the [Release Planning - R25.06 - Preparation](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/36)

You’re encouraged to collaborate across groups as needed, and we’ll provide **Teams sessions** (we will use the same sessions from Refinement Day 1) for each group to work in.
It might be the case for some experts to jump into different other groups to resolve dependencies.

- **Date:** Wednesday, 12th February 2025
- **Time:** 09:05 - 12:00
- **Main Teams Link:** [Join the session](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MWVjNTkwNTEtYTFiZS00ODI5LWE4MTgtMzE5MWM2ZGIwMzgw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%221ad22c6d-2f08-4f05-a0ba-e17f6ce88380%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22a8b7a5ee-66ff-4695-afa2-08f893d8aaf6%22%7d)

- Identify dependencies with other components or groups and add the correct labels to the features
- Use the supported-by field to map the feature with your expert group
- help each other to solve/analyze dependencies

At the end of the refinement session, we’ll regroup and present the progress made. Each expert group will present their refined features, focusing on what’s been developed so far and the key insights.

:::note
If the feature is ready refined, the status should be set to `Backlog`-> this should be an alignment, between the requesting Expert Group/Committee and the open-source community.

### Agenda

Here’s the plan for the day:
- **09:05 - 09:30**: Open Planning - Vision & Introduction
- **09:45 - 16:00**: Joint Open Planning (all teams)
- **16:00 - 16:30**: Confidence Vote & Feedback Retro
- **16:30 - 17:00**: Open Planning Wrap-Up / Summary & Next Steps

The planning sessions will be driven by our [Release Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/28?filterQuery=-status%3ADone+has%3Asupported-by+label%3A%22Prep-R25.06%22+status%3ABacklog), which organizes features based on their **supported-by** field.

### Prerequisites for features to be considered in Open Planning

For a feature to be included in the Open Planning, the following conditions must be met:
- **Status must be 'Backlog'** – Committers and Expert Groups can set this status after the feature is fully refined.
- **All categories in the feature template must be filled** – Do not delete any sections from the template.
- **Milestone is NOT set** – This will be assigned during the Open Planning session.
- **Contributor and Committer must be assigned**.
- **Supported-by must be set**.

During the session, if there is a common alignment among the participants, the feature milestone can be set to **25.06**, meaning it will be developed in the upcoming release.

### Important Notes and Hints

- Keep the board clean – there are still features with older milestones that have not yet been completed.
- Do not delete any sections from the feature template, except for KITs.
- For KITs, only the Contributor, Committer, and Description fields need to be filled.

For any questions or further information, feel free to reach out via our [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) or join us in the Tractus-X [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#automotive.tractusx:matrix.eclipse.org).

We look forward to your participation and collaboration! 🚀

Hello, Eclipse Tractus-X Community!

We are excited to announce the **Eclipse Tractus-X Release Planning Days** for Release 25.03, which will take place on **November 13th and 14th, 2024**. These days are the
final step in aligning and confirming the features for our next release.


## Prerequisites

Before participating in the Open Planning, please have a look at the previous **Refinement Days**:
- [Refinement Day 1 for Release 25.03](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/blog/refinement-day-1-R25.03) and the [slides](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io.largefiles/raw/refs/heads/main/presentations/R25.03_SLIDES_REFINEMENTDAY_ONE.pdf)
- [Refinement Day 2 for Release 25.03](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/blog/refinement-day-2-R25.03)

These Refinement Days were crucial for laying the groundwork and ensuring features are properly prepared for the release planning.

## Prerequisites for features to be considered in Open Planning

For a feature to be included in the Open Planning, the following conditions must be met:
- **Status must be 'Backlog'** – Committers and Expert Groups can set this status after the feature is fully refined.
- **All categories in the feature template must be filled** – Do not delete any sections from the template.
- **Milestone is NOT set** – This will be assigned during the Open Planning session.
- **Contributor and Committer must be assigned**.
- **Supported-by must be set**.

During the session, if there is a common alignment among the participants, the feature milestone can be set to **25.03**, meaning it will be developed in the upcoming release.

## Important Notes and Hints

- Keep the board clean – there are still features with older milestones that have not yet been completed.
- Do not delete any sections from the feature template, except for KITs.
- For KITs, only the Contributor, Committer, and Description fields need to be filled.

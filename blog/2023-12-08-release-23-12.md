We are pleased to announce the Tractus-X Release 23.12! This release brings important improvements to our Catena-X operating system and KITs in terms of robustness, documentation, and usability (e.g. enhanced error handling) for all data space participants.

Catena-X Operating System (cxOS):
We have significantly improved the performance, deployability, and the automation of our test approach of our core and enablement services. We realized our vision of multi-operating-company scenarios by fully enabling the Onboarding Service Provider Role, which allows various companies to perform the registration process now.

Use Cases & Value Creation:
With five new use case KITs and the Knowledge Agent KIT, we are introducing exciting new offerings to solve the toughest industry problems such as Demand and Capacity Management and Circular Economy together. The Knowledge Agent KIT provides a new compute-to-data approach, that is already implemented in the Remaining Useful Life KIT.

Data Space Governance:
The Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. will provide the corresponding standards ( https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library) as well as 101 pager describing Catena-X in an easy way ( https://catena-x.net/de/library).

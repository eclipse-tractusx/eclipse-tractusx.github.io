### Known Knowns

- All not listed products and KITs have not been updated and are based on the release 25.09
  - These products were not part of the testing phase
- The Eclipse Tractus-X release does not include an Identity Wallet. The development team decided on a temporary bridging solution, based on a commercial application, to test and ship the releases 24.08, 24.12, 25.03, 25.06, 25.09 and 25.12. Without implementing this interim solution, participants will not be able to fully utilize this release in consequence.
- For E2E Testing, the [2.2.3](https://github.com/SAP/ssi-dim-middle-layer/releases/tag/v2.2.3) of the [SSI DIM Middle Layer](https://github.com/SAP/ssi-dim-middle-layer) was used - this component is FOSS but the currently used wallet (see previous item) is not

### Runtime

The following runtime has been used during end-to-end test:

- [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) version: `1.29.10`
- Applications used
  - [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) version: `15.4.0` or more specifically `15.4.0-debian-11-r45`
  - Tractus-X Connector version [0.11.0](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/releases/tag/0.11.0)
  - DTR version [0.10.0](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-digital-twin-registry/releases/tag/v0.10.0)

:::note

Tractus-X Connector has been tested on both Postgresql versions: 15.x and 16.x

### Using helm with central helm registry

You can search all released helm charts with the following commands:

```shell
helm repo add tractusx-dev https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/charts/dev
helm repo update tractusx-dev
helm search repo tractusx-dev --versions
```

### Bitnami changes

The official Bitnami Helm chart repository has been deprecated or is no longer maintained in its previous location. Bitnami has migrated legacy
container images to a new repository called `bitnamilegacy`. Helm charts using Bitnami container images must be updated to reference this new source
to ensure continued functionality. With `bitnamilegacy` we won’t receive security updates.

:::tip

If you are using a provided helm chart from Eclipse Tractus-X that uses Bitnami container images and it doesn't work, please check the values.yaml file of the respective chart
and update/overwrite the image repository from `bitnami/<image-name>` to `bitnamilegacy/<image-name>`.

:::

Extract from `values.yaml`:

```yaml
postgresql:
  image:
    # -- workaround to use bitnamilegacy chart
    repository: bitnamilegacy/postgresql
    tag: 15.4.0-debian-11-r45
```

:::tip

For installation details, please see the referenced Repositories / Releases and related documentation (e.g. migration documentation)

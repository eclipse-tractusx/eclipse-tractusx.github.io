### Known Knowns

- All not listed products and KITs have not been updated and are based on the release 24.12
  - These products were not part of the e2e testing phase
  - And are not tested with the current EDC version 0.9.0
- The Eclipse Tractus-X release does not include an Identity Wallet. The development team decided on a temporary bridging solution, based on a commercial application, to test and ship the releases 24.08, 24.12 and 25.03. Without implementing this interim solution, participants will not be able to fully utilize this release in consequence.
- For E2E Testing, the [2.2.1](https://github.com/SAP/ssi-dim-middle-layer/releases/tag/v2.2.1) of the [SSI DIM Middle Layer](https://github.com/SAP/ssi-dim-middle-layer) was used - this component is FOSS but the currently used wallet (see previous item) is not.
- BPNL Group Validation for a Policy does not allow a Collection as a rightOperand -> see [Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/issues/1674)
- EDR token refresh implementation is inconsistent and deviates from the documentation -> see [Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/issues/1565)
- Consumer-Asset with the same ID as a Provider-Asset Cannot Be Deleted After Contract Negotiation -> see [Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/issues/4583)
- Termination of pull transfer process from consumer side does not succeed -> see [Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/issues/4592)
- Fatal error while resume PULL transfer process -> see [Issue](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/issues/4591)

#### EDC

- Any EDC will not work with a Hashicorp Vault version 1.18.1 as this version has a bug, incompatibilities to other versions are not known.
- Compared with the catalog from version 0.7.7, the "endpointUrl" property in a Dataset is always in namespace "dcat", a redundant property in namespace "dct" is not available anymore.

#### BDRS

- BDRS will not work with a Hashicorp Vault version 1.18.1 as this version has a bug, incompatibilities to other versions are not known.

#### Digital Product Pass

- [Digital Product Pass (DPP)](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/digital-product-pass) will be not part of the release

#### Knowledge Agents

- [Knowledge Agents](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/knowledge-agents) is not part of this release but was tested with the EDC release candidate 0.8.0-RC4

#### Portal

- Note for Gaia-X Clearing House Tagus upgrade (Portal v2.4.0, Eclipse Tractus-X R25.03):
  - If a company was onboarded with ELBE clearing house, the legal person self description document is not accepted when creating a connector with newer versions of the clearing house. Portal operators are advised to create new legal person and connector self description documents for all previously onboarded companies.
  - As of v2.4.0, the portal backend will activate connector without updated legal person self description document to allow for a transition phase. The connector will not have a document until reissuance for both company and connector is triggered by operators.
  - An automatic reissuance system is planned for the future.
- When registering two connectors (EDCs) under one technical user, the technical user will be duplicated and the details of the technical user will not be shown

### Runtime

- on [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) versions: `1.29.10`
- with [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) versions: `15.4.0.` or more specific `15.4.0-debian-11-r45`
- the EDC version [0.9.0-rc2](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/releases/tag/0.9.0-rc2) was used for testing

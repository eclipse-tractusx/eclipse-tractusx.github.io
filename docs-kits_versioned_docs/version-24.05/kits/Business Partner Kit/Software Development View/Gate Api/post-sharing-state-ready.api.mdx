## Sets the given business partners into ready to be shared state



The business partners to set the ready state for are identified by their external-id. Only business partners in an initial or error state can be set to ready. If any given business partner could not be set into ready state for any reason (for example, it has not been found or it is in the wrong state) the whole request fails (all or nothing approach).

Catena-X data models rely on principles as understandability, standardization, accuracy, differentiation, auditability, comprehensiveness, and provision of insights to drive improvement actions. The KIT entails the main data models of a Digital Product Passport and Battery Passport, whereat both are justified with an underlying regulation.

Other specific product passports which are further described in the EcoPass KIT are the [battery](#battery-passport), [transmission](#transmission-passport) and [electric drive](#electric-drive-passport). All of them depend on the generic Digital Product Passport data model. Further data models will follow.

The goal of these passports is to create unified data models that can be used and adapted across the automotive industry. These data models are modelled according to the [CX-0003](https://catena-x.net/en/standard-library) SAMM Standard in Version 1.1.0 (updated link once published). For detailed information please follow the embedded links to the Catena-X Standard library.

### Digital Product Passport

#### Digital Product Passport Introduction

Digital Product Passports addresses three needs by the industry: First, they gather all relevant information about a product in a single, digital tool. Second, digital product passports answer increasing regulatory requirements and demand for sustainability information along the value chain of a product. And third, Digital Product Passports are an important enabler for a circular economy.
The collected data is defined via standards specified by the Catena-X network and obtained from the industry. The content of the Product Passport is product-related information that is useful and necessary for the consumer, and other actors who will deal with the product till end of its life, and is limited to the required minimum of the necessary information.
The data model in version 4.0.0 corresponds to the Digital Product Passport information required by the proposed Ecodesign Regulation ([ESPR-2022](<(https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en)>)) from March 30th, 2022. In the future, delegated acts for specific product groups would require a product passport to be available for each product. The data model will be updated, as newer versions of the regulation will be published. The latest to the model corresponding version of the document was the [provisional agreement](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:ST_5147_2024_INIT) between the EU Council and the Parliament from January 9th, 2024. The text is informal, but the content of the final regulation was agreed between these two institutions.

It is important to note that the data model contains information/data fields, which are mandatory for the fulfilment of the regulation ([ESPR-2022](<(https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en)>)). It is also worth mentioning that sharing information within the network is based on decentralized technologies and is always based on the individual decision of each provider.

The Digital Product Passport is the core model and can be used as the root class for other, specific, product models. The latest model `v.4.0.0` consists out of the following information:

- Passport metadata
- Product identification
- Product operation
- Product handling
- Product characteristic
- Sustainability information
- Materials information
- Commercial information
- Sources (documents)
- Additional data

In addition, the Digital Product Passport data model offers the following advantages:

- **Self-describing**: Which means it has all the details necessary to comprehend what it includes. Different systems can easily interpret the Passport as a result.
- **Extendable**: New information can be added without much difficulty. As a result, the Passport will be able to adapt to the changing requirements.
- **Common semantics**: The model of a generic passport is established in Catena-X which other passes can build upon.

#### Link to current Digital Product Passport model

The semantic models are located [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport). For each version there is a separated directory containing the ttl-file and generated samples.

### Battery Passport

#### Battery Passport Introduction

The Catena-X standards, which are crucial to create a more sustainable battery business, serve as the foundation for the data model behind the Battery Passport. The Battery Passport assists in enhancing the traceability and sustainability of batteries by offering a thorough record of a battery's life cycle. This will mitigate the battery industry's environmental effect and make it easier to recycle batteries.

Due to requirements of the regulation [(EU) 2023/1542](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542) for batteries and waste batteries, a data model for Battery Passport was created, which increases the efficiency of circular economy ecosystems of all partners in the value network. The battery passport is a tool for the exchange of information and enables tracking and tracing of batteries usage information.
The Battery Passport is a standardized data model that will enable stakeholders to access the relevant data. The version of the Battery Passport Data Model `v.5.0.0` consists out of the following information:

- Passport metadata
- Product identification
- Product operation
- Product handling
- Product characteristic
- Sustainability information
- Materials information
- Commercial information
- Sources (documents)
- Conformity information
- Safety information
- Performance information

It is important to note that the data model contains information/data fields, which are mandatory for the fulfilment of the regulation ([(EU) 2023/1542](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542)). It is also worth mentioning that sharing information within the network is based on decentralized technologies and is always based on the individual decision of each provider.

#### Link to current Battery Pass model

The semantic models are located [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.battery.battery_pass). For each version there is a separated directory containing the ttl-file and a generated samples.

The latest version is the `v5.0.0` which is based on the generic Digital Product Passport `v4.0.0` model which can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport).

### Transmission Passport

#### Transmission Passport Introduction

In July 2023, the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation addressing the whole life cycle of vehicles, from design to end-of-life, aimed at improving design and end-of-life management of vehicles for a more resource-efficient automotive sector. It would set circularity requirements on vehicle design and production concerning reusability, recyclability, recoverability and the use of recycled content. It would also lay down requirements on information and labelling of parts, components and materials in vehicles.

As preparation for the implementation of the proposed regulation and its requirements, manufacturers and OEMs within the Catena-X network decided on developing data models for the most commonly used products.

In contrast to the previous version `v.1.0.0` of the transmission, the Transmission Passport `v.2.0.0` corresponds to the [digital product passport](#digital-product-passport) information required by the proposed Ecodesign Regulation and describes the data that is collected and available during the lifespan of a transmission. The consumers can see at a glance the relevant data about the transmission which is installed in the specified vehicle. By incorporating circularity parameters, the Transmission Passport aims to enhance transparency and promote a circular economy within the European Union. Detailed descriptions can be found in the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation Proposal (ESPR).
The Transmission Passport model `v.2.0.0` includes the following product specific information:

- Type of drive
- Transmission performance information
- Torque converter information
- Speed resistance information
- Standard gear ratio information
- Transmission spreading information
- Transmission oil information
- Electric machine information
- Electric performance information

Product unspecific information incudes following information:

- Passport metadata
- Product identification
- Product operation
- Product handling
- Product characteristic
- Sustainability information
- Materials information
- Commercial information
- Sources (documents)

It is important to note that the data model contains information/data fields, which are mandatory for the fulfilment of the regulation ([ESPR-2022](<(https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en)>)). It is also worth mentioning that sharing information within the network is based on decentralized technologies and is always based on the individual decision of each provider.

#### Link to current Transmission Passport model

The semantic models are located [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.transmission.transmission_pass). For each version there is a separated directory containing the ttl-file and a generated samples.

### Electric Drive Passport

#### Electric Drive Introduction

In July 2023, the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation addressing the whole life cycle of vehicles, from design to end-of-life, aimed at improving design and end-of-life management of vehicles for a more resource-efficient automotive sector. As preparation for the implementation of the proposed regulation and its requirements, manufacturers and OEMs within the Catena-X network decided on developing data models for the most commonly used products. As well as the transmission, the electric drive is one of such a component.

The data model corresponds to the [digital product passport](#digital-product-passport) information required by the proposed Ecodesign Regulation and describes the data that is collected and available during the lifespan of a electric drive. The consumers can see at a glance the relevant data about the electric drive which is installed in the specified vehicle. The Electric Drive Passport model `v.1.0.0` includes the following product specific information:

- General information
- System and performance data
- Inverter information
- E-Machine information
- Transmission information
- Cooling and lubricants information
- Specific documents

Product unspecific information incudes following information:

- Passport metadata
- Product identification
- Product operation
- Product handling
- Product characteristic
- Sustainability information
- Materials information
- Commercial information
- Sources (documents)

It is important to note that the data model contains information/data fields, which are mandatory for the fulfilment of the regulation ([ESPR-2022](<(https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en)>)). It is also worth mentioning that sharing information within the network is based on decentralized technologies and is always based on the individual decision of each provider.

#### Link to current Electric Drive model

The semantic models are located [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.electric_drive.electric_drive_passport). For each version there is a separated directory containing the ttl-file and a generated samples.

## Creation of new passports

The process for the creation can be structured like following:

- Preparation phase
- Research phase
- Documentation phase
- Approval phase I.
- Data modelling phase
- Approval phase II.
- Release phase
- Communication & Standardization

In case of a new proposal, the checking of the already existing passports or aspect models is necessary. If none of the already existing passports or aspect models comply with the proposed requirements a new passport must be requested.

In case of request from one of the involved companies, the checking of the already existing passports or aspect models is necessary. If none of the already existing aspect models fulfil the request a new aspect model must be requested.

Development teams should be formed and designated. The team members must be from at least two different companies, that has involvement in the production of the product which the aspect model was requested for. From each of the involved companies subject matter experts should get involved. Involvement of a legal expert is necessary. The lifecycle of the product and the related scenarios should be discovered and documented. Scenarios should be assigned to the responsible parties. All responsible parties should validate their data availability.

Collection of possible data attributes must be documented in a shared file. The possible data attributes should be aligned with the already existing, related aspect models to avoid duplications. After the list of the possible attributes are agreed on by the responsible parties, for testing and validation purposes other companies should be involved.

In case of a new or changed aspect model, the changes need to be submitted and requested from the association. The approval is dependent on many different factors.

Linking with other already existing data models, if reasonable, is mandatory. The data model must be created with the catena-x conform modelling language.

To get the approval, specific requirements have to be fulfilled. Several iterations between modelling adjustments and reviews can be made.

Note: Data model creation and standardization will be supported in the association

## Business Architecture

The Business Architecture illustrates the interaction between the EcoPass KIT and other KITs, components, data models, and artifacts used for identity and access management, illustrated by the Figure below.

The core of the network is to provide interoperability between different applications. For this reason, a common semantic is indispensable. In the Catena-X ecosystem, it has been agreed to use the description language SAMM to describe data models.
To additionally provide a standardized interface, the open standard of the International Digital Twin Association (IDTA) is used, abbreviated as IDTA. This [standard](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IDTA-01002-3-0_SpecificationAssetAdministrationShell_Part2_API.pdf) corresponds to the Asset Administration Shell (AAS 3.0).
It is used to discover digital twins and exchange actual usage data. The registration and search of digital twins is done by using the [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Digital%20Twin%20Kit/Adoption%20View%20Digital%20Twin%20Kit) which reference implementation is the [Digital Twin Registry](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-digital-twin-registry/tree/main) in Tractus-X.
To control access to both usage and meta data, the EcoPass KIT relies on the [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/tractusx-edc/docs/kit/adoption-view/Adoption%20View/). Interactions between two parties occur exclusively peer-to-peer via the standardized interfaces of the Connector KIT, based on the International Data Space Protocol.
Data sovereignty is enabled by so-called verifiable credentials. These rely on the technology of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and are enabled through the Connector KIT. In short, consumers must present their signed credentials, defined by a data provider, before a data contract (and thus a data exchange) can take place. It should be mentioned that this concept is still in the prototype phase as of Release 3.2 and will be expanded in future releases.

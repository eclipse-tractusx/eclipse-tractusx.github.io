### Quality KIT

## Quality Data Offers at EDC

When a Data Consumer calls the Catalog of a Data Provider, the Data Provider must signal in each Data Offer what exactly
a Consumer could negotiate for. Data Offers in the Catalog are sorted by dcat:Datasets which are registered in the EDC-
Management API as edc:Asset. Each Asset has private and public properties. The public properties are shown in the
catalog and give hints to the Data Consumer what API and data they may expect. There are some properties that are
mandatory for the entire Catena-X network and some that are mandatory only in specific Business Scenarios (like
Quality).

The dataAddress object's structure is determined by the dataplane implementation as it configures the details of the
data transfer. They are not visible via the catalog.

The following suggestion is a non-standardized draft how Assets (and thus by proxy, dcat:Datasets) should be registered
in the Quality Use-Case.

```json

  "@context": {
    "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",

### S3 Data Address

This section is not use-case specific but since the EDC's AmazonS3 dataplane is basically undocumented, here is an
explanation:

| Property              | Value                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `edc:type`            | `"AmazonS3"`                 | This shows which data source the Data Plane will query. It also determines what other content the `dataAddress` object must hold.                                                                                                    |
| `edc:region`          | `"eu-west-1"`                | This property represents the AWS-region where the source bucket is located.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `edc:bucketName`      | `"provider-quality-bucket"`  | This is the name of the source bucket that the data to-be-transferred resides in.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `edc:keyName`         | `"path/through/provider/s3"` | This is the path of the file that shall be offered to the dataspace.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `edc:accessKeyId`     | `"<keyId>"`                  | Amazon S3 uses this property similarly to how oauth2 client credentials use the `clientId`. Note that this can also be set during deployment-time for the whole S3-dataplane. If it's set here, it will override the default config. |
| `edc:secretAccessKey` | `"<secretAccessKey>"`        | This secret is used similarly to a `clientSecret` in oauth2 client credentials.                                                                                                                                                      |

### Properties

| Property                                           | Value                                                            | Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In the Quality Use-Case, this is identified as `https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#QualityAsset`. The expected payload this API serves is determined by the `dcat:conformsTo` property.                                                                                                            |

As it points to an IRI, it must be embedded in a json-object with the `@id` key. The use of this is unclear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

As currently only parquet files are used, the type application/octet-stream with the added property type=parquet-snappy must be used. The syntax is expained [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types-parameters/media-types-parameters.xhtml). If in the future csv shall be supported, the value could also be `text/csv`. |

It holds the exact aspect-model-URN that defines the schema of the presented dataset including its version. The version in here refers to the data model's version while the EDC-property `cx-common:version` defines the version of the underlying API serving the data.                                                                                                                         |

All Asset types defined in this Kit must include this property as it links the data behind an asset with the correct QualityTask. Note that the id of the QualityTask must be used, not the id of the EDC-Asset shielding said QualityTask.                                                                                                                                                       |

The expectation that this would be signaled via the dcat:DataSet-dcat:distribution property of the catalog currently isn't implemented in the EDC. Thus the data must be replicated here and is presented via the same property that the consumer-side `transferprocesses` API uses for this same signal.                                  |

In this EDC-property, only major and minor increments should be added.                                                                                                                            |

For the process described in the KIT Quality, data exchange between the participating partner companies is necessarily
to be done for large vehicle and product populations. The data exchange therefore should be done as a file download via
EDC according to the following specifications.

### **Asset File type**

It is recommended to create and transfer the files in the type parquet. Only attachments for the Quality task (Quality
Task Attachment) should be created in ZIP format.

### **Asset Transfers via EDC**

File transfer is recommended to be done via EDC S3 plane, The transfer via EDC http data plane is not recommended due to
the big data size.

### **Asset consumption**

**File** flattening **rules**: The data provided in the asset is build from 4 to 6 structures. To assure a secure and
smooth exchange flatting rules for the file (csv / xls / Parquet / json) must be applied. This includes checks for
format and possible values for each column and will be part of next version regulations. If the rules are not applied
correctly the mapping of content will not be possible without manual handling effort.

## Sample Data

Standard version from: 09.2023

In the following, example data for the standardized data models are provided as download in zip format. The sample data
is generated according the current standards. It contains a virtual fleet of 50.000 vehicles where two quality issues
are implemented.

- Production failure of product "zehn" at Tier 1
- Specification failure

## Introduction

This page lists tests that can be executed by the business role customer.

They are written in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).

For an overview of these tests you should visit [Testing a DCM application](./overview.md#testing-a-dcm-application) within the Development View of this KIT.

## Customer: Prepare yourself

### Setup EDC

This test ensures that the customer sets up its EDC.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Prepare yourself

Scenario: Setup EDC
  Given I have joined the Catena-X dataspace and want to execute DCM tests
  When I check whether I have setup my EDC or not
  Then I should confirm that I have setup my EDC in the correct version successfully 
```

### Register APIs as assets

This test ensures that the customer registers its API endpoints as data assets with its own EDC.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Prepare yourself

Scenario Outline: Register APIs as assets
  Given my EDC has been setup correctly
  When I check the asset catalog of my own EDC
  Then I should find an asset for the <API> with the correct <taxonomy> and <version> 

Examples:
| API                         | taxonomy                           | version |
| WeekBasedCapacityGroup API  | cx-taxo:DcmWeekBasedCapacityGroup  | 2.0     |
| RequestForUpdate API        | cx-taxo:DcmIdBasedRequestForUpdate | 2.0     |
| IdBasedComment API          | cx-taxo:DcmIdBasedComment          | 2.0     |
```

### Check wallet for certificates

This test ensures that the customer has the necessary credentials in its wallet.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Prepare yourself

Scenario Outline: Check wallet for certificates
  Given I have been successfully onboarded into the Catena-X dataspace 
  When I check my wallet
  Then I should find a <credential> that corresponds to a <policy> 

Examples:
| credential                 | policy                     |
| BPN-restricted Data Usage  | BPN-restricted Data Usage  |
| Membership Credential      | Membership Credential      |
| DataExchangeGovernance:1.0 | DataExchangeGovernance:1.0 |
```

### Prepare variables for other tests

This test ensures that the customer is aware of the fact that some tests contain variables that need to be filled in with the correct values before executing the tests.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Prepare yourself
  
  Scenario Outline: Prepare variables for other tests
  Given I want to execute a <test> that uses a <variable> I need to have a <value> assigned to <variable> that makes sense in the context of the <test> and use the value of the variable instead of its name when testing.
  When the test gets executed
  Then it should work as intended

Examples:
| test                                                                                                                | variable  | value                                                                                                                                                          |

### Prepare for base journey

This test ensures that the customer is aware of the sequence of communication and naming conventions within the base journey.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Prepare yourself
  
  Scenario Outline: Prepare for base journey
  Given I want to execute the base journey which uses <object> in <test> to fulfill a certain <function> that I need to be aware of in order to execute my part of the base journey successfully
  When the test gets executed
  Then it should work as intended

Examples:
| object     | function                                                                                           | test                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Create invalid IdBasedRequestForUpdate

This test checks the implementation of the aspect model as well as some edge cases.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Create IdBasedRequestForUpdate

Scenario Outline: Try to generate invalid IdBasedRequestForUpdate
  Given   the value for the property "weekBasedMaterialDemand"        is <v_weekBasedMaterialDemand>
  *       "weekBasedMaterialDemand"                                   is a list with properties "changedAt" and "materialDemandId"
  *       the value for the property "weekBasedCapacityGroup"         is <v_weekBasedCapacityGroup>
  *       "weekBasedCapacityGroup"                                    is a list with properties "changedAt" and "materialDemandId"
  When the application tries to generate the IdBasedRequestForUpdate
  Then it should NOT generate the IdBasedRequestForUpdate and throw an <error> instead

Examples:
| v_weekBasedMaterialDemand | v_weekBasedCapacityGroup | error                                                 |
| This should not compute   | {{OMITTED}}              | AspectModel Conformity Error: weekBasedMaterialDemand |
| {{OMITTED}}               | This should not compute  | AspectModel Conformity Error: weekBasedCapacityGroup  |

```

### Create IdBasedRequestForUpdate for base journey

The customer creates an IdBasedRequestForUpdate used by the base journey which requests WeekBasedCapacityGroup Alpha, identified via \{\{UUID_CG1\}\}.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Create IdBasedRequestForUpdate

Scenario Outline: Try to generate  IdBasedRequestForUpdate for base journey using different <v_tests>
  Given   the value for the property "weekBasedMaterialDemand"        is <v_weekBasedMaterialDemand>
  *       "weekBasedMaterialDemand"                                   is a list with properties "changedAt" and "materialDemandId"
  *       the value for the property "weekBasedCapacityGroup"         is <v_weekBasedCapacityGroup>
  *       "weekBasedCapacityGroup"                                    is a list with properties "changedAt" and "materialDemandId"
  When the application tries to generate the IdBasedRequestForUpdate
  Then it should generate the IdBasedRequestForUpdate

Examples:
| v_tests  | v_weekBasedMaterialDemand | v_weekBasedCapacityGroup              |
| RU_alpha | {{OMITTED}}               | [ {"capacityGroupId" : {{UUID_CG1}}}] |

### Create invalid IdBasedComment

This test checks the implementation of the aspect model as well as some edge cases.

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Create IdBasedComment

Scenario Outline: Try to generate invalid IdBasedComment
  Given   the value for the property "CommentId"                      is <v_CommentId>                            with a default value of "a54348ce-7373-4cf0-8f00-8a73ea323dab"
  *       the value for the property "ObjectId"                       is <v_ObjectId>                             with a default value of "b01fac51-6e7f-4754-a762-11814a1ff243"
  *       the value for the property "CommentType"                    is <v_CommentType>                          with a default value of "default"

  *       the value for the property "supplier"                       is <v_supplier>                             with a default value of "{{BPNL_SUP}}"
  *       the value for the property "customer"                       is <v_customer>                             with a default value of "{{BPNL_CUS}}"
  *       the value for the property "CommentText"                    is <v_commentText>                          with a default value of "This is a comment. Very nice! "
  *       the value for the property "requestDelete"                  is <v_requestDelete>                        with a default value of "false"
  *       the value for the property "objectType"                     is <v_objectType>                           with a default value of "urn:samm:io.catenax.week_based_capacity_group"
  *       the value for the property "postedAt"                       is <v_postedAt>                             with a default value of "2024-03-10T12:27:11.320Z"
  *       the value for the property "changedAt"                      is <v_changedAt>                            with a default value of "2024-03-10T12:27:11.320Z"
  When the application tries to generate the IdBasedComment
  Then it should NOT generate the IdBasedComment and throw an <error> instead

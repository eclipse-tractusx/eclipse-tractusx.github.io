The following page offers an architecture perspective including the main building blocks and information regarding
communication between different components, shown as sequence diagrams in a runtime view. In general, data access must
be provided in the Catena-X network using the Data Space Protocol (DSP). As standard for data-level interoperability,
the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard is used - this is relevant for registering data via the Digital Twin
Registry (short DTR), as well as for delivery of said data. SAMM is used as modelling language to model a Digital Twin's
aspects, yielding json-schema that defines the payloads and context for runtime data.

## Assumptions

This architecture is based on the following assumptions:

- There is a complete setup of the Catena-X Dataspace available with all Core Services as defined by the [Operating Model Whitepaper v2.1](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/_online_media_/CX_Operating_Modelv2.1_final.pdf).
- All users have **completed onboarding** to the Catena-X network. This includes:
    - All participants hold a Verifiable Credential issued by an Operating Company (Core Service Provider B)
    - All participants have at least one Dataspace Connector deployed that's linked to their BPNL at the EDC Discovery
      Service.
    - All participants have an active network membership that is represented in their membership credential.
    - Data Providers operate a Digital Twin Registry according to
      the [Digital Twin Kit](/digital-twin-kit/adoption-view)
    - Data Providers expose their data via the Submodel API according to the Digital Twin Kit.
- The **customers of parts** (on catalog and instance level) must be known when creating a digital twin and registering
  its data. Registering data in EDC and DTR requires data providers to define appropriate access permissions to prevent
  exposing data to unauthorized parties. For Traceability, the customer of a part must have access to the digital twin
  in
  the DTR as well as to the digital twin's data in the EDC. If the customer is not known when a digital twin is created,
  additional processes must be set up by the data provider to add access permissions for the customer at a later time.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Lawfulness

Automotive supply chains hold sensitive data. Not only can improper exposure lead to the loss of trade-secrets but it can also violate antitrust regulations - especially when gaining access to sensitive data of horizontal competitors. As this can jeopardize the business of a company, especially Data Providers (and by proxy Business Application Providers) must ensure that their solutions are not only secure by default but also provide ergonomic and reliable means for configuration.

### Correctness

Data Chains are built up of the links to resources distributed among the supply chain. This is reflected in distributed data. Publishing incorrect or outdated data to the network will have ripple-on effects that may break the chain for all interested parties. To avoid this, implementation strictly according to standard, verified by rigorous certification, is critical for the success of the Industry Core and the network as a whole.

### Resilience

While processing data for publishing it to Catena-X, a data provider needs to access the digital twins of built-in parts from suppliers. These must be available in Catena-X at this point. If these digital twins are not found while the data provider is looking them up, the data provider will not be able to integrate these built-in parts into BoM aspect models (e.g., SingleLevelBomAsBuilt) as it is missing the built-in parts' Unique ID. Reasons for not finding a built-in part's digital twin can be:

  1. There is a network failure while the data provider's is looking for the digital twin.
  2. The supplier did not yet create the digital twin, e.g., because its internal processes were delayed
  3. The supplier is not yet part of the Catena-X network.

Resilience means that the data provider implements a pipeline that can cope with these issues. Digital twins are provided with the information that is available and are updated once more information is available (e.g., the supplier provides digital twins for built-in parts later on).

### Backward Compatibility and Versioning

Effective management of versions and changes for Catena-X standards, KITs, and open source reference implementations is crucial to guarantee compatibility, interoperability and security especially in a decentralized data space. The Catena-X lifecycle management coordinates quarterly releases, including one major release and three minor releases per year. Only a major release may contain breaking changes and does not need to be backward compatible.

The Catena-X data space aims to support a parallel phase of two major versions of 12 months to ensure a smooth upgrade process. Data providers and data consumers must take special care to prepare for such releases by planing necessary migrations in time. This means that, e.g., a Traceability app that was built for the previous (major) Catena-X release will still work in an environment that is running the new major release.

  - **For digital twins and aspect models**, this means that data providers and data consumers must at least support mandatory aspect model versions from the oldest, still supported major release. Newer mandatory aspect model versions can be optionally supported. A data provider cannot assume that all data consumers are already able to process newer aspect model versions. A data consumer cannot assume that all data providers already provide their data in newer aspect model versions.

  Mandatory versions for aspect models can only change in a major release as this change is breaking. Optional versions can be introduced with minor and patch versions, e.g., to introduce a future mandatory version first as optional for easier migration later on.

  A data provider that wants to support several versions of an aspect models must add a separate submodelDescriptor for every supported aspect model version to the digital twin. The submodelDescriptors will have different semanticIds and might also point to different EDC assets - depending on the asset structure used in the EDC for providing the digital twin's sumodel.

  A data consumer must search the submodelDescriptors of a digital twin for supported semanticIds and then select the most suitable one for further processing.

  - **For Notification APIs**, a separate EDC asset must be created for every major API version, e.g., for versions v1 and v2 of the API separate EDC assets must be created. The API version must be documented in the `https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#version` property on a minor release level (e.g., 1.1). It is not necessary to create a separate EDC asset for every minor or patch version as these versions must always be backward compatible.

More information about backward compatibility and versioning can be found here:
- [Life Cycle Management 101](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/_online_media_/231006_Whitepaper_LifeCycleManagement.pdf) from the Catana-X Standard Library,
- [Digital Twin KIT - Registration at EDC](/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/#registration-at-edc) with details about versioning of EDC assets (for submodels as well as for Notification assets) including examples.

## Building Block View

## Runtime View

The runtime patterns represent a subset of the interactions specified in the Digital Twin Kit.
Its ["Interaction Patterns" section](/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/interaction-patterns)
describes the interaction between a Data Provider and Data Consumer including the necessary configuration steps.
Since the Discovery Services according to CX-0053 are not part of the Industry Core, all calls going to the components
`DiscoveryFinder` and `BPN Discovery Service` can be omitted.

## Standards

A formal definition of the Industry Core's content is given in the standards CX-0126 and CX-0127 - first released in
CX R24-03. These two standards build on a common subset of technologies that are themselves described in Catena-X standards.

The two standards share a common set of base technologies. And while the Industry Core does provide Business-relevant
capabilities for Data Consumers, it can likewise serve as a launchpad for new use-cases.

![Locating the Industry Core standards in the Catena-X landscape](./assets/ic-arch-view-stds.svg)

The Interoperability Layer the Industry Core Standards build on, defines API structures of Data Providers and relevant
core services hosted centrally. They depend on the EDC Discovery Service defined in standard CX-0001 to discover a
participant's the EDC-endpoint. CX-0002 is the standard for the integration between assets and related data - leveraging
the Asset Administration Shell standard as adopted by Catena-X. Its correct deployment is especially critical as its
services (Digital Twin Registry and Submodel Endpoints) are operated by all Data Providers.

The Identity and Sovereignty Layers are defined in a variety of Catena-X standards that are assumed to be deployed and
integrated form the foundation for data exchange in Catena-X.

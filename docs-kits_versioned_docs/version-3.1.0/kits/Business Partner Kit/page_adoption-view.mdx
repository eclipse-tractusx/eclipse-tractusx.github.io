## Status Quo
**Todays challenge for automotive companies**

Most of today’s automotive companies have to invest a significant amount of resources to keep their individual partner master data updated and correct, since outdated or incorrect data records result in federal fines and wrong claims / billing processes. The industry spends a vast amount into an area that is non differentiating, regulated and executed redundantly across the partners.

For this, cutting individual company costs by offering the golden master data record as a shared service is the mission. And proactively reduce Business Partner risk via collaborative value-add services.

- Time to value within 6 months, due to standard interfaces and mapping tools (e.g. SAP)
- Increase data quality and use industry collective wisdom to act pro-actively (e.g. fraud alerts)

- The Kit enables the offering of value-add services and innovation based on golden record and collective wisdom.
- Potential to scale customer group and access new market potentials via marketplace and shared service network.

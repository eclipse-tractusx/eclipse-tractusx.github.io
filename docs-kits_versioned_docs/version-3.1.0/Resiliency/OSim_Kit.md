<!--VISION of the Kit-->
## Gain increased supply chain transparency through collaborative simulation across all stakeholders

### Combine simulations of plants internally with simulations of external logistics over multiple tiers

<!--MISSION of the Kit-->
The online simulation (OSim) Kit defines the mechanisms and services needed to enable every Catena-X partner (producer as well as logisticians) to exchange, combine and re-use simulation models in an open, interoperable and Catena-X compliant way.

Online simulation aims at linking production simulation with logistics simulation in order to identify delivery problems earlier and react in response to changing customer requirements or external disturbances/events. This contrasts with conventional planning and simulation tools primarily taking the plant level into account. See [Status Quo](#status-quo) below for more details on Online Simulation.

The OSim Kit describes an open architecture for integrating partners of all kinds together with standardized interfaces and semantic models.

The OSim Kit is continuously under development and future extensions and improvements will help you to adopt or extend functionality even faster.

<!--BUSINESS VALUE of the Kit-->
### Integrate any simulation tool

Thanks to its open architecture OSim is independent of the simulation tools that partners use.

### Integrate any supply chain partner

Even partners that are not using any simulation tool can contribute to the overall transparency through the well-defined information requirements.

<!--Description of the domain for which the Kit provide the developer support-->
### Status Quo

The online simulation enables every Catena-X partner (producer as well as logisticians) considering simulation results of their partners to simulate own processes by sharing the simulation results on supply chain level in contrast to conventional planning and simulation tools, where the simulation was used on the plant level only.

The simulation results of the Catena-X partners on the lower tier level and logistics, together with data of the company's own operations are fed into a simulation model as input. Considering both, plannable and unforeseeable influencing factors, this simulation model is iterated through as often as necessary until an optimal result has been found. Sharing of simulation results to the next tier level is the basis of the collaborative simulation approach on a short-term timescale, across the complete supply chain.

A central application takes over the tasks of monitoring and controlling the transmission of the simulation results, regardless of the level of digitalization of the partners. In addition, this application takes over the control of the simulation tools used.

#### Benefits for OEM, SME and Solution Provider

- Scenario management can be used to identify that alternative material flow should be requested or to play out what-if scenarios with new material flows
  
- Early detection and reaction to delivery problems
  
- Early response to changing customer requirements
  
- Take external disturbances/events into account early

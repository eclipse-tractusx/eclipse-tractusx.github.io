## Use Case

**Status Quo**
**Todays challenge for automotive companies**

Most of today’s automotive companies have to invest a significant amount of resources to keep their individual partner master data updated and correct, since outdated or incorrect data records result in federal fines and wrong claims / billing processes. The industry spends a vast amount into an area that is non differentiating, regulated and executed redundantly across the partners.

For this, cutting individual company costs by offering the golden master data record as a shared service is the mission. And proactively reduce Business Partner risk via collaborative value-add services.

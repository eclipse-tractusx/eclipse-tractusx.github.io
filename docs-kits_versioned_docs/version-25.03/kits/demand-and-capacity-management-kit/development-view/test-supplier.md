## Introduction

This page lists tests that can be executed by the business role supplier.

They are written in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).

For an overview of these tests you should visit [Testing a DCM application](./overview.md#testing-a-dcm-application) within the Development View of this KIT.

## Supplier: Prepare yourself

### Setup EDC

<details>
<summary>This test ensures that the supplier sets up its EDC.</summary>

```cucumber
Feature: Supplier: Prepare yourself

Scenario: Setup EDC
  Given I have joined the Catena-X dataspace and want to execute DCM tests
  When I check whether I have setup my EDC or not
  Then I should confirm that I have setup my EDC in the correct version successfully 
```

</details>

### Register APIs as assets

<details>
<summary>This test ensures that the supplier registers its API endpoints as data assets with its own EDC.</summary>

```cucumber
Feature: Supplier: Prepare yourself

Scenario Outline: Register APIs as assets
  Given my EDC has been setup correctly
  When I check the asset catalog of my own EDC
  Then I should find an asset for the <API> with the correct <taxonomy> and <version> 

Examples:
| API                         | Taxonomy                           | Version |
| WeekBasedMaterialDemand API | cx-taxo:DcmWeekBasedMaterialDemand | 2.0     |
| RequestForUpdate API        | cx-taxo:DcmIdBasedRequestForUpdate | 2.0     |
| IdBasedComment API          | cx-taxo:DcmIdBasedComment          | 2.0     |
```

</details>

### Check wallet for certificates

<details>
<summary>This test ensures that the supplier has the necessary credentials in its wallet.</summary>

```cucumber
Feature: Supplier: Prepare yourself

Scenario Outline: Check wallet for certificates
  Given I have been successfully onboarded into the Catena-X dataspace 
  When I check my wallet
  Then I should find a <credential> that corresponds to a <policy> 

Examples:
| credential                 | policy                     |
| BPN-restricted Data Usage  | BPN-restricted Data Usage  |
| Membership Credential      | Membership Credential      |
| DataExchangeGovernance:1.0 | DataExchangeGovernance:1.0 |
```

</details>

### Prepare variables for other tests

<details>
<summary>This test ensures that the supplier is aware of the fact that some tests contain variables that need to be filled in with the correct values before executing the tests.</summary>

```cucumber
Feature: Supplier: Prepare yourself
  
Scenario Outline: Prepare 
  Given I want to execute a <test> that uses a <variable> I need to have a <value> assigned to <variable> that makes sense in the context of the <test> and use the value of the variable instead of its name when testing.
  When the test gets executed
  Then it should work as intended

Examples:

### Calculation for simulated delta production journey

<details>
<summary>The supplier compares the demand data, sent to the supplier, to the capacity data, received from the supplier. This comparison takes deltaProductionResult into account.</summary>

```cucumber

Scenario Outline: Calculation for simulated delta production journey
  Given    I have successfully consumed <WeekBasedMaterialDemand>

  When     I compare demand and capacity data for <WeekBasedCapacityGroup>
  Then     I should get <result> for <week> in <year> after considering deltaProductionResult

  When the application tries to generate the IdBasedComment
  Then it should NOT generate the IdBasedComment and throw an <error> instead

### Create IdBasedComment for base journey

<details>
<summary>The supplier creates two IdBasedComment used by the base journey.</summary>

```cucumber
Feature: Customer: Create IdBasedComment

Scenario Outline: Try to generate IdBasedComment for base journey using different <v_tests>

  Given   the value for the property "CommentId"                      is <v_CommentId>
  *       the value for the property "ObjectId"                       is <v_ObjectId>
  *       the value for the property "CommentType"                    is <v_CommentType>
  *       the value for the property "listOfReferenceDates"           is <v_listOfReferenceDates>
  *       the value for the property "author"                         is <v_author>
  *       the value for the property "supplier"                       is <v_supplier>
  *       the value for the property "customer"                       is <v_customer>
  *       the value for the property "CommentText"                    is <v_commentText>
  *       the value for the property "requestDelete"                  is <v_requestDelete>
  *       the value for the property "objectType"                     is <v_objectType>
  *       the value for the property "postedAt"                       is <v_postedAt>
  *       the value for the property "changedAt"                      is <v_changedAt>
  When the application tries to generate the IdBasedComment
  Then it should generate the IdBasedComment

Examples:
| v_tests  | v_CommentId   | v_ObjectId   | v_CommentType | v_listOfReferenceDates | v_author                  | v_supplier   | v_customer   | v_CommentText                                                                            | v_requestDelete | v_objectType                                  | v_postedAt | v_changedAt |
| CT_gamma | {{UUID_COM2}} | {{UUID_CG1}} | warning       | {{OMITTED}}            | max.mustermann@company.de | {{BPNL_SUP}} | {{BPNL_CUS}} | "Capacity set to 0 because machine is destroyed."                                        | false           | urn:samm:io.catenax.week_based_capacity_group | {{TS_NOW}} | {{TS_NOW}}  |
| CT_delta | {{UUID_COM4}} | {{UUID_CG1}} | default       | {{OMITTED}}            | max.mustermann@company.de | {{BPNL_SUP}} | {{BPNL_CUS}} | "Capacity set to 0 in CW45 due to machine maintenance. Please set demand in CW 45 to 0." | false           | urn:samm:io.catenax.week_based_capacity_group | {{TS_NOW}} | {{TS_NOW}}  |

## Supplier: Provide IdBasedComment

### Provide valid IdBasedComment

<details>
<summary>This test checks the basic implementation of the API.</summary>

```cucumber
Feature: Supplier: Provide IdBasedComment

Scenario: Provide valid new IdBasedComment
  Given the commentID of the IdBasedComment is unknown to my supplier
  When I try to provide my customer with said IdBasedComment
  Then I should get an http 201 status message

Scenario: Provide valid existing IdBasedComment
  Given the commentID of the IdBasedComment is already known to my supplier
  When I try to provide my customer with said IdBasedComment
  Then I should get an http 200 status message
```

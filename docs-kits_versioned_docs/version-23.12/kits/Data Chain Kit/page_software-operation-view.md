### Data Chain KIT

## Local Deployment

> **Please note that this demo is currently based on IRS version 2.4.0.**

Run a working demo scenario of the Item Relationship Service with a mocked Catena-X network to retrieve data chains with the following components:

* Item Relationship Service
* Eclipse Dataspace Connector for accessing data
* Eclipse Dataspace Connector for data provisioning
* a submodel server and testdata for provisioning test digital twins
* an OIDC authentication provider mock
* Registry Service to register test digital twins
* Item Relationship Service Debugging View to visualize the results of the Item Relationship Service

This emulates the communication over EDC, retrieving assets via a registry and building one continuous data chain with data from different companies.

This local deployment is an easy installation with helm. This setup is built to run on a kubernetes cluster.

| Step                                                                             | Action                              | Description                                                             |

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed and the Docker deamon is running with at least 8GB of memory
2. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) is installed
3. [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is installed and running.  
   You can also use any other local Kubernetes cluster, this guide is just using Minikube as a reference.

   ```bash
   minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 2 
   ```

   _Optional_: enable minikube metrics

   ```bash
   minikube addons enable metrics-server
   ```

4. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) is installed
5. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed
6. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/de/documentation/installation/) is installed
7. [psql](https://www.compose.com/articles/postgresql-tips-installing-the-postgresql-client/) client is installed

### Step 2: Check out the code

Check out the project [Item Relationship Service](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service) or download a [released version](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/releases) of the Item Relationship Service

> ðŸ‘‰ **Please use [tag 2.6.0](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/releases/tag/2.6.0) instead
of the latest version currently (this is the version compatible with IRS 2.4.0).**
>
> ```git clone -b 2.6.0 https://github.com/catenax-ng/tx-item-relationship-service```


### Step 3: Installing the services

#### 1. Start the cluster

To deploy the services on kubernetes, run

```bash
cd local/deployment/full-irs
./start.sh true true
```

The script takes 2 parameters as input:

* INSTALL_EDC: default is set to true. If this is passed as true, will delete all helm charts related to EDC (vault, DAPS, EDC consumer and EDC provider) and install them again.
* INSTALL_IRS: default is set to true. If this is passed as true, will delete all helm charts related to IRS (dependencies, IRS backend and IRS frontend) and install them again.

This can take up to **20 minutes**.

When the deployment is finished you can expect that 13 deployments can be seen in the minikube dashboard:

* irs-frontend
* irs
* irs-minio
* keycloak (mocked Service)
* digital-twin-registry
* semantic-hub (mocked Service)
* irs-provider-backend
* edc-provider-control-plane
* edc-provider-data-plane
* edc-consumer-control-plane
* edc-consumer-data-plane
* edc-vault-agent-injector

Also in total 17 Pods are up and running.

**INFO**: sometimes you will get the following message during deployment, which can be ignored. This is caused when a service takes longer than 90 seconds to be available.

```bash
-e Waiting for the deployments to be available
error: timed out waiting for the condition on deployments/irs-frontend
```

##### 1.1 Get the status of the deployment

The minikube dashboard will give you feedback on how the status of the deployment currently is:

```bash
  minikube dashboard 
```

Make sure you select the namespace **irs**:

![expected status](@site/static/img/minikube-dashboard-overview.png)

#### 2. Forward ports

When the deployment has been finished, please use the script to forward the ports:

```bash
./forwardingPorts.sh
```

After that you can access the:

* **Digital Twin Registry:** [http://localhost:10200](http://localhost:10200)
* **IRS Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### 3. Prepare test data

> Only if Step 2 has been applied and the ports are forwarded.

To provision testdata to the provider EDC and register the testdata with the Digital Twin Registry, use the following script:

```bash
./upload-testdata.sh
```

If you like, you can remove the test data with:

```bash
./deleteIRSTestData.sh
```

### Step 4: Access the Debugging View

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and you should see the Item Relationship Service login screen. **Just press Login.**

![irs-login](@site/static/img/irs-login.png)

## Testing the Item Relationship Service

You can use several approaches to interact with the IRS. One is through the **IRS API** and another way is through the **IRS API Frontend**.

### Valid Global Asset IDs for testing

Use these globalAssetId's for testing:

| globalAssetId | type |
|---------------|------|
| urn:uuid:d3c0bf85-d44f-47c5-990d-fec8a36065c6 | vehicle combustion engine |
| urn:uuid:61a22b1c-5725-41fb-8e1e-dccaaba83838 | vehicle combustion engine |
| urn:uuid:513d7be8-e7e4-49f4-a22b-8cd31317e454 | vehicle combustion engine |

### Valid test requests for testing

Use these snippets for testing purposes.

```json
{
  "aspects": [
    "AssemblyPartRelationship",
    "SerialPartTypization"
  ],
  "bomLifecycle": "asBuilt",
  "collectAspects": true,
  "direction": "downward",
  "depth": 10,
  "globalAssetId": "urn:uuid:d387fa8e-603c-42bd-98c3-4d87fef8d2bb"
}
````

```json
{
  "aspects": [
    "SerialPartTypization"
  ],
  "depth": 1,
  "globalAssetId": "urn:uuid:d387fa8e-603c-42bd-98c3-4d87fef8d2bb"
}
```

<!-- #### Get global asset id

1. Forward ports of digital twin database: ``` kubectl port-forward svc/digital-twin-registry-database 5432:5432 ```
2. Connect to the database: ``` export PGPASSWORD=digital-twin-registry-pass; psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d digital-twin-registry -U digital-twin-registry-user ```
3. Execute query to get the global asset id: ``` select id_external from shell where id_short = 'VehicleCombustion' limit 1; ``` -->

### Testing the IRS API endpoints

#### Precondition

* Visual Studio extension: [REST Client by Huachao Mao](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
* All installation steps have been conducted successfully
* A valid Global Asset ID

#### Test-steps

1. To interact with the API Endpoints, you need a valid token. You can generate an access token by using the ``` ./test/keycloack-service.rest ```.
2. **copy & paste** the valid token into line 8 of ``` ./test/irs-backend-service.rest ```
3. **copy & paste** a valid globalAssetId into the request body
4. **execute the request** ```./test/irs-backend-service.rest```

### Testing with the IRS frontend

#### Precondition

* All installation steps have been conducted successfully

#### Test-steps

1. **open** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click 'Login'
2. **copy & paste** a valid globalAssetId into the request body
   ![irs-new-job](@site/static/img/irs-new-job.png)
3. **click** 'Build Data Chain' to start a new IRS job
4. **click** 'Visualization' to see the result of the job
   ![irs-job-list](@site/static/img/irs-job-list.png)

### Step 2: Verify Results

The following example shows a visual overview of all retrieved data assets and digital twins of a data chain.

_Item Relationship Service visualization overview_

With the following snippet, all clickable objects will be explained:

* **Digital Twin:** the box itself is clickable and will open an overlay to show more information on this object.
* **Aspect:** the green button is clickable and represents an Aspect or Submodel of the twin.
* **Relationship Aspect:** the line between Digital Twins is clickable and will give detailed Information about the relationship between the twins.

## Stopping the cluster

1. stop minikube

    ```bash
    minikube stop
    ```

2. stop the processes used for port forwarding and minikube dashboard
3. shut down the Docker daemon

## How to debug an application in the cluster

If you want to connect your IDE to one of the applications in the cluster, you need to enable debug mode for that application by overriding the entrypoint (using the `command` and `args` fields in the deployment resource). How to do this depends on the application. For the IRS, as it is based on Spring Boot and Java, you would need to add this flag to the start command:

```bash
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000
```

Then you can forward the port 8000 for the IRS deployment to your host machine and connect your IDE to that port.

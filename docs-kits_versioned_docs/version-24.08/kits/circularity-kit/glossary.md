| Digital Twin                                | The Digital Twin is a virtual representation of assets and adheres to the following characteristics: The DT has at least one Catena-X-wide unique ID. Digital Twins are organized by a set of Aspects. The set can be extended over lifetime. An Aspect of a DT includes both structural as well as behavioral data and models (including operations and simulation models). The semantics of an Aspect can be described via semantic models A single Aspect can be connected to different heterogenous data sources (including behavioural models) The DT can represent asset types (e.g. virtual prototype of a car) and asset instances (e.g. real car) A DT can cover the whole asset lifecycle including (e.g. planning phase, production, sales, use and decommissioning phase). However, in practice there may be more than one twin with different IDs representing different lifecycle phases (e.g. a twin for types and multiple twins for instances). An asset can have more than one DT The DT represents current available information about an asset (synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity) which can be leveraged for simulation and business process integration By using aspects the DT can reference other DT to express "part of" or "consists of" relations | Catena-X definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Mass Balance                                | Mass balance is one of several well-known chain of custody approaches that can be used to track the flow of materials through the value chain. The total quantity of the content in question is tracked through the production system and the allocation of this content is made to the end products based on verifiable accounting. The goal of this method is to ensure proper accounting and to confirm a link between the incoming content (e.g., "sustainable," "recycled," or "organic" according to some definition) and the eventual outgoing product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [https://www.basf.com/global/documents/de/sustainability/we-source-responsibly/Mass-Balance-White-Paper-2020.pdf](https://www.basf.com/global/documents/de/sustainability/we-source-responsibly/Mass-Balance-White-Paper-2020.pdf)                                                |

| Mechanical Recycling                        | End-of-life materials can be processed via collecting, sorting, shredding, melting and transforming it into secondary raw materials for a new application. This form of recycling involves processes in which e.g. the polymer structure is not significantly changed and the plastic is preserved as a material. Thus, in terms of its complexity, mechanical recycling takes place at a lower technical level than chemical recycling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Mechanical recycling (basf.com)](https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/sustainability/we-drive-sustainable-solutions/circular-economy/mechanical-recycling.html) [Glossar und Methoden / Statistikportal.de](https://www.statistikportal.de/de/ugrdl/glossar-und-methoden#P) |

| Digital Twin                                | The Digital Twin is a virtual representation of assets and adheres to the following characteristics: The DT has at least one Catena-X-wide unique ID. Digital Twins are organized by a set of Aspects. The set can be extended over lifetime. An Aspect of a DT includes both structural as well as behavioral data and models (including operations and simulation models). The semantics of an Aspect can be described via semantic models A single Aspect can be connected to different heterogenous data sources (including behavioural models) The DT can represent asset types (e.g. virtual prototype of a car) and asset instances (e.g. real car) A DT can cover the whole asset lifecycle including (e.g. planning phase, production, sales, use and decommissioning phase). However, in practice there may be more than one twin with different IDs representing different lifecycle phases (e.g. a twin for types and multiple twins for instances). An asset can have more than one DT The DT represents current available information about an asset (synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity) which can be leveraged for simulation and business process integration By using aspects the DT can reference other DT to express "part of" or "consists of" relations | Catena-X definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Mass Balance                                | Mass balance is one of several well-known chain of custody approaches that can be used to track the flow of materials through the value chain. The total quantity of the content in question is tracked through the production system and the allocation of this content is made to the end products based on verifiable accounting. The goal of this method is to ensure proper accounting and to confirm a link between the incoming content (e.g., "sustainable," "recycled," or "organic" according to some definition) and the eventual outgoing product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [https://www.basf.com/global/documents/de/sustainability/we-source-responsibly/Mass-Balance-White-Paper-2020.pdf](https://www.basf.com/global/documents/de/sustainability/we-source-responsibly/Mass-Balance-White-Paper-2020.pdf)                                                |

| Mechanical Recycling                        | End-of-life materials can be processed via collecting, sorting, shredding, melting and transforming it into secondary raw materials for a new application. This form of recycling involves processes in which e.g. the polymer structure is not significantly changed and the plastic is preserved as a material. Thus, in terms of its complexity, mechanical recycling takes place at a lower technical level than chemical recycling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Mechanical recycling (basf.com)](https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/sustainability/we-drive-sustainable-solutions/circular-economy/mechanical-recycling.html) [Glossar und Methoden/Statistikportal.de](https://www.statistikportal.de/de/ugrdl/glossar-und-methoden#P)   |

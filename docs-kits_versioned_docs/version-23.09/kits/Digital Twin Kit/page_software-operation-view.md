### Digital Twin KIT

<!--
Documentation of the kit.
-->

Based on the information provided in this kit, it is possible to run and program against an infrastructure of
Digital Twins the Catena-X-way. This infrastructure empowers Data Consumers to consume the network's data as agreed with
each Data Provider and facilitated by an Operating Company. They run central and decentral services that allow them to
discover each other, exchange information and contextualize it according to a standardized semantics.

<!--VISION of the Kit-->
## Increase production flexibility and leverage existing business potential for lot size one

### Automate the orchestration of production resources and planning processes

<!--MISSION of the Kit-->
The Modular Production (MP) Kit defines services, interfaces and data models based on industry standards with the goal to increase flexibility and reliability of industrial production. Furthermore services that provide information about production status and planning that is required by other use cases will be provided.

Modular Production has the goal to support individual production (batch size 1) at the price of series production. In particular, this is to be achieved by automating the orchestration of production resources and planning of production processes as much as possible, thus significantly reducing effort and planning times.

See [Status Quo](#status-quo) below for more details on Modular Production.

The Modular Production Kit is continuously under development and future extensions and improvements will help you to adopt or extend functionality even faster.

<!--BUSINESS VALUE of the Kit-->
#### Connect and access to shopfloor information for further value creation

Due dates, machines used etc. for specific individual produced product are made available through standardized service to the Catena-X network honoring access and data sovereignty rules.

<!--Description of the domain for which the Kit provide the developer support-->
### Status Quo

Higher-level, external influencing factors from the supply chain, such as delays in the logistics chain for supplier parts or short-term order changes, may invalidate a production plan that has already been drawn up. Today, such short-term changes in the general conditions of the production process can often only be taken into consideration indirectly and made through manual corrections.

### Benefits for OEM, SME and Solution Provider

A growth in efficiency in the sense of the OEE is achieved in that production can be reconfigured in the event of faults to continue operating as well as possible. The increased flexibility creates the space for new business models, such as the interposition of highly prioritized, lucrative orders.

Further benefits and value can be generated through additional services or apps that connect to the shopfloor information service via the Catena-X platform.

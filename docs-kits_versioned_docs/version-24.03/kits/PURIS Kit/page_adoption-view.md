### PURIS Kit

## Vision & Mission

### Vision

Demand and capacity management (DCM) increases transparency in the supply chain and provides information on potential supply bottlenecks in the medium to long term by comparing a customer's material requirements and the supplier's capacities in the initial one-tier supply relationship (one-down, one-up). By linking the information, bottleneck situations that go beyond the one-tier supply relationship and arise at lower levels of the n-tier supply chain can also be identified. This early detection enables problems to be solved before they affect production and thus timely delivery. If bottleneck situations nevertheless occur in the short-term horizon, the data must be enriched with additional, up-to-date information and the current stock situation, material movements and inbound and outbound deliveries must also be taken into account.

For those involved in the supply chain, the Catena-X application PURIS is a short-term tool for transparently mapping delivery situations.

In contrast to DCM in the long term, PURIS presents the delivery situation with actual data, without aggregation and completely in real time, in order to enable the user to derive measures for the corresponding requirement (e.g. in bottleneck management) on this basis and to be able to make decisions more reliably.

### Mission

The Catena-X application PURIS is available to all participants in the automotive supply chain. It depicts the current situation based on actual data (as opposed to planned data) with the option of an operational preview of a maximum of 4 weeks.

The application enables all participants in the supply chain to exchange information (type, quantity, time, etc.) with participants of their choice (one-up/one-down) and to use this for their own findings.

Information objects are

- Stock
- transportation
- demand
- Supplier production (output)
- Other influencing variables
- This exchange should be possible automatically, autonomously and independently, with minimal manual effort. Applicable guidelines are adhered to.

The application should be usable regardless of company size and degree of digitization. The financial outlay for using PURIS should be as low as possible. It is intended to serve as a basic building block for a future industry standard and serves as a supplier.

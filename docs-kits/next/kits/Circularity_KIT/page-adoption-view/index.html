In the dynamic landscape of modern industry, the pursuit of a circular economy has become increasingly vital. This transformative approach seeks to minimize waste and enhance resource efficiency by promoting the reuse, recycling and repurposing of materials throughout their entire lifecycle. However, the realization of a truly circular economy faces significant challenges, primarily stemming from the absence of standardized data exchange and communication among the diverse network of stakeholders involved in the process.</p><p>Currently, there is a notable absence of a uniform data format or exchange mechanism for recycled materials within industrial processes and value chains. This lack of transparency presents a barrier to comprehending the flow of materials and recycled materials circulating within this ecosystem. Without a standardized approach, tracking the contributions of recycled materials, assessing their successful reintegration into the circular loop, and quantifying output volumes remain challenging tasks.</p><p>The circular economy involves a complex interplay of various stakeholders, ranging from tier-n companies to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), each employing unique methods for measuring inputs and outputs. The overarching objective of the material accounting feature in the Circularity KIT, therefore, is to make the circular economy visible and digitally verifiable across the automotive value chain. To realize this ambition, a standardized framework is imperative, one that facilitates the exchange of material data for both primary and secondary raw materials, including corresponding quantities and qualities, illuminating material flows across the entire value chain.</p><p>The image below shows the big picture of a circular economy when material is tracked over its complete life cycle excluding the usage phase.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="figure-2">Figure 2<a class="hash-link" href="#figure-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Overview Material flow" src="/assets/images/overview_material_flow-262c2f524e918880d88646d4e3f3b78b.svg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="business-value">Business Value<a class="hash-link" href="#business-value" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From a business perspective, the material accounting KIT is characterized by the following attributes:</p><ol><li><strong>Standardized Data Exchange:</strong> Facilitation of standardized data exchange regarding scrap, waste, and secondary materials among ecosystem partners.</li><li><strong>Verifiable Closed Loops:</strong> The KIT enables the establishment of verifiable closed loops for material tracking.</li><li><strong>Increased Material Recycling:</strong> The KIT promotes the recycling of materials within the same industry, increasing sustainability.</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> It provides higher transparency regarding the availability of secondary materials.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="use-case--domain">Use Case / Domain<a class="hash-link" href="#use-case--domain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="material-accounting-in-catena-x">Material Accounting in Catena-X<a class="hash-link" href="#material-accounting-in-catena-x" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Catena-X offers a decentral, sovereign, cross-organizational data exchange.

Chain of custody is an administrative process by which information about materials is transferred, monitored, and controlled as those materials move through supply chains <!-- -->[ISO 22095:2020]<!-- -->. There are in principle four chains of custody models possible, illustrated in the figure below. Their common objective is to guarantee correct bookkeeping and to corroborate a link between in-going content, e.g., ‘sustainable’, ‘recycled’ or ‘organic’ by harmonized definitions, and the finally out-going product. They differ regarding physical or administrative links. Furthermore, they differ on the set of rules for balancing, and the possibility to keep materials streams segregated or not.</p><p><strong>Figure 6</strong>

It involves balancing volume reconciliation to ensure the exact account of volumes of in- and out-of-scope source is maintained along the supply chain, provided that the volume or the ratio of sustainable material integrated is reflected in the product produced and sold to customers. This model requires that a reconciliation period is defined (e.g. a month, a year).</td><td>Buying a certain percentage of a supply from certified origin. Applies to, e.g., sustainable forestry for wooden materials, recycled, bio-based or renewable materials, organic cotton</td></tr><tr><td>Book and claim – restricted certificate trading</td><td>The certified product / component is disconnected from the certification data but belongs to the same production system or value chain. The certified product evolves in separate flows from the certified supply. Certificates are issued at the beginning of the supply chain by an independent body reflecting the sustainable content of supplies. The intended outcome is that outputs from one supply chain are associated with total claims corresponding to the certified input.</td><td>Buying material with renewable/recycled/ biobased content. Certificates with guarantee of origin or comparable certifications declaring e.g. recycled, renewable, biobased content.

The balance between input and output shall be correct.</p><p>The mass balance approach helps enabling fossil raw materials to be replaced by more sustainable alternative materials (e.g. with recycled content, bio-content). In contrast to a segregated use of alternative raw materials, mass balance enables to use existing production networks with minimized or no investments into new process technologies and production facilities. A book and claim model can be applied when there is no direct connection between the final product and the certified supply. An example for a book and claim model is applied in green electricity markets and receives more attention in other sectors as a way to support circular transformation of the industry, therefore it is accepted as a solution.

Importantly, we view the end of a vehicle&#x27;s life as the beginning of a new one in the context of resource conservation.</p><p>Our overarching vision is to create a landscape that closes loops and preserves resources, ultimately empowering circularity in the industry. We aspire to provide digitized and scalable EoL services that align with circular economy principles and prioritize the preservation of components and materials. Simultaneously, we are committed to follow present and future changes in laws and regulations, which emphasizes environmentally friendly vehicle disposal and the recovery of critical raw materials (CRMs), aligning with the growing demand for closing component and material loops.</p><p>Our mission centres on empowering EoL and maintenance stakeholders by fostering continuous collaboration within the Catena-X Network and beyond. Through the Circularity KIT working group, we aim to develop and align various means, including data, business, and network models, to empower all stakeholders involved in the EoL phase. This mission is closely tied to our vision of promoting digitized and scalable end-of-life services across the industry while upholding the principles of circular economy.</p><p>Our strategy for achieving these goals involves several key steps. Firstly, we aim to enable EoL service models through data sharing based on digital twins (DT). This approach allows for efficient information sharing in an interoperable, standardized manner, which, in turn, supports dismantling and recycling operations. Furthermore, we are actively engaging with all relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, product designers (for circularity), and EoL service providers, to promote new &quot;R-approaches&quot; and facilitate their implementation.</p><p>Ultimately, our efforts provide essential support for the digitalization and automation of the EoL phase, with the ultimate goal of closing loops in the automotive sector. Through these digitized and scalable EoL services, we aim to contribute significantly to sustainable development and resource conservation, aligning with the principles of the circular economy.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="business-context-1">Business Context<a class="hash-link" href="#business-context-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-journey-end-of-life">Data Journey &quot;End-of-Life&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#data-journey-end-of-life" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The &quot;Data Journey&quot; represents the entire process of dismantling an End-of-Life (EoL) vehicle.

In this context, the automotive industry faces many challenges including the increasing scarcity of natural resources, a rising demand in terms of sustainable vehicle design, production and materials sourcing. Due to all this, end-of-life decisions regarding dismantling have become increasingly important. A high proportion of secondary materials will be required in the vehicles of the future. To response to these challenges, companies have turned their focus towards the circular economy as a central approach to close material loops. In the German research project “Catena-X” a new data ecosystem with digital twins is one enabler that is being developed. The digital twins represent a promising approach to the circular economy by ensuring transparent, product-specific and end-to-end data exchange throughout the entire product lifecycle, from the material sourcing to the eventual dismantling and recycling. As one particular and unique solution, a decision framework that facilitates the best circular strategy at the end of a vehicle&#x27;s life is developed and presented in this paper. The underlying data-driven decision support framework is based on circular economy KPIs. This includes material, components and specific vehicle KPIs to best identify the most suitable circular strategy. The framework was methodologically developed by an interdisciplinary team of partners, who are stakeholders throughout the value chain and participants in the Catena-X project. An integrated approach of user-centered design, an adapted version of the V-model and the Scaled Agile Framework were used for the methodology in the development of the solution. The paper presents the concept of a digital twin for a decision support system, that includes a central decision logic that also includes the relevant KPIs and a survey for evaluating the decision logic utilized with a chosen dismantling company.</li><li><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827123006091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">End-of-life decision support to enable circular economy in the automotive industry based on digital twin data - ScienceDirect</a></li></ul><p><strong>Empowering End-of-Life Vehicle Decision Making with Cross-Company Data Exchange and Data Sovereignty via Catena-X</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Abstract:</strong> The mobility sector is the world’s second-largest producer of energy-related CO2 emissions, and it is facing a global resource shortage. The demand for circular products, the use of secondary materials in future vehicles, and the need for sustainable business models in the mobility sector is increasing. However, a transparent and end-to-end data exchange throughout the entire value network is missing, which is hindering an efficient circular economy. Relevant information on the vehicle, its components and materials at the end of the product life cycle are often missing. In this context, this paper presents a decision support system based on Digital Twin data for a circular economy solution as a software application. It was developed within the German research project Catena-X following an integrated approach of user-centered design, the V-model, and within the Scaled Agile Framework. By combining these methodological approaches, customer-oriented solutions were developed and continuously improved at each stage of development to shorten the time-to-market. Catena-X is based on Gaia-X principles. In Gaia-X, necessary core services are developed, and contraction negotiation for data exchange and usage policies is enabled and implemented. The decision support system provides important information about the exact composition and condition of the vehicle, its components, and its materials. Thus, it helps to improve efficiency, sustainability, and the implementation of the circular economy. The decision support system was tested and validated with a use case that provided Digital Twin data on the end-of-life vehicle.</li><li><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/9/7187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustainability | Free Full-Text | Empowering End-of-Life Vehicle Decision Making with Cross-Company Data Exchange and Data Sovereignty via Catena-X (mdpi.com)</a></li></ul><p><strong>Digital Twins for Circular Economy - Enabling Decision Support for R-Strategies</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Digital twins (DT) for circular economy (CE) offer a promising approach as part of digital data ecosystems for more sustainable value creation. By mapping and analyzing product, component and material specific data along the lifecycle, it is possible to address current challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity. Within Catena-X, specific solutions based on this cross-company exchanged data and information are developed. Here, the “CE-Assistant” is presented. It is an application, which identifies the best CE-Strategy based on DT data at the end of a vehicle&#x27;s life.</li><li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.industrie-management.de/node/556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OA_Mügge_6-2022 | INDUSTRIE-MANAGEMENT</a></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="logic-schema">Logic /Schema<a class="hash-link" href="#logic-schema" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In order to evaluate which R-Strategy can be applied to individual components, instance-specific data must be available. This is ensured using DT data throughout the product lifecycle. Such an DT enables the collection of instance-specific data on the product, and thus provides the missing EoL data for vehicle disassembly.</p><p>Depending on the decision-making step, instance specific data for the vehicle disassembly is partly necessary or product specific data is sufficient. Decision support regarding the best R-Strategy is preceded by the logic for the technical feasibility. Thus, only when the R-Strategy is technically feasible, it must be checked for other indicators.</p><p>The outcome of the technical feasibility is to analyze if an R-Strategy has to be excluded at the beginning based on regulatory requirements regarding an R-Strategy or a defect in functionality of specific components.</p><p>The process is started by entering the vehicle identification number (VIN) into the system, thereby requesting the corresponding Catena-X data. The registered companies in the Catena-X network act as data providers for this vehicle-specific data, as they register respective assets and sub-models. Catena-X Shared Services handle existing data models, contract, usage and access control policies, and ultimately the final data exchange.</p><p>The system shows the first information, such as corresponding vehicle, component and material based on data from the DT. This data is provided for the first overall manual inspection and evaluation. After that, the user selects the most relevant components for the R-Strategy decision. The decision logic is applied for this component and the possible R-Strategies are identified.</p><p>The core process means in a chronological order: The basic reuse-potential, material composition and remaining lifetime in comparison with the specific thresholds and the disassembly capability.</p><p>If one or more of these criteria are not fulfilled, the component will only be assigned to recovery or recycling. If the component qualifies for disassembly, a manual visual inspection and a functional check are conducted. For components, where the visual condition is relevant, such as body parts and interior components, the visual inspection is conducted first. In contrast, components, for which the technical condition is of significant relevance, such as engines and gearboxes, are first subjected to a functional test. Here, the data can also be provided in the Catena-X network as an update of the DT. Thereafter, a quality comparison of the component condition with threshold values takes place. When the quality is insufficient for reuse, the technical check for remanufacturing is carried out chronologically: Assimilability, cleanability and restorability/upgradability. Finally, a possible strategy is given to the user as a result.</p><p><strong>Figure 11</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="user story flowchart" src="/assets/images/figure11-ab92a043f32f1a885539f5e4c21aaaaf.svg" width="1436" height="730" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="glossary">Glossary<a class="hash-link" href="#glossary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Aggregate State/ State of Matter</td><td>State of matter (German: &quot;Aggregatzustand&quot;) is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist.

## Introduction

The Development View provides information and resources for implementing the PURIS standards.. The architecture chapter
describes the interactions of all components in the PURIS context as well as the shared asset approach. The policies
chapter describes the access policies, usage policies, contract definitions and include information about the framework
agreement. The protocol chapter gives examples how the connector data asset is registered and how shell descriptors are
created. In the chapter sample data the PURIS aspect models are defined with a reference to the turtle file and an
example JSON payload. For the ready PURIS implementation and quick installation guides, please see Operation View.

## Architecture

This chapter shows the interactions of all necessary components required to fulfill the PURIS standards.

Also the standards' transferred data objects are shown in the Catena-X context of registered assets.

### Component Architecture (High-Level View)

Figure 1 shows the high-level architecture of the Submodel exchange in the Catena-X dataspace and the services that are
involved. Both the data provider and the data consumer must be members of the Catena-X network in order to communicate
with each other. With the help of the Identity Access Management (IAM) each participant can authenticate itself, verify
the identity including associated claims (see Usage Purpose section) of the requesting party and decide whether to
authorize the request. For a local deployment of the portal including the IAM components, please refer to
the [umbrella helm chart](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-umbrella "https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-umbrella").
The data is provisioned in accordance with
the [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/kits/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/interaction-patterns)
in Catena-X. The architecture in this figure only applies to standards that are based on the Digital Twins in
Catena-X ([Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/kits/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/interaction-patterns)).

### Component Architecture (Conceptual Whitebox View)

From conceptual point of view a PURIS system consists of different building blocks. These building blocks in the
following diagram show which participant deploys which components. Identification and Access Management is omitted for
simplicity reasons.

The PURIS App is a software application that allows to exchange relevant data with partners. It's meant to

- Provide data following the shared asset approach (see Digital Twin KIT). It manages the Digital Twin Registry (AAS
  Registry and AAS Discovery API) and provides the data in the correct format via Submodel API.
- Manage the apis and assets in the Connector (
  see [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/category/connector-kit)).

The following components are needed for the communication based on the PURIS standard:

- PURIS App: Component orchestrating the Data Exchange following this KIT (as explained above) while providing business
  value.
- Connector: Component that manages data and API as assets to enable the sovereign data exchange (see Connector KIT)
- Digital Twin Registry: Component that provides AAS Registry and AAS Discovery API implementations (see Digital Twin
  KIT)
- Data Provisioning & Transformation: Proprietary component allowing to use OWN data or to use PURIS data in internal
  systems.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Identity Provider spanning authentication and authorization within Catena-X
  and / or your company. Includes the Credential Service to proof e.g. that a participant signed the Framework
  Agreement.

Beside that a partner may use the Discovery Service in Catena-X to determine the EDC for a partner based on a Business
Partner Number Legal Entity. As there already exists a contractual basis, this information in the PURIS context can be
considered as known a-priori.

### Distribution of aspects in shared asset approach

Figure 2 shows how the shared asset approach is realized. The orange lines show which submodels belong to the respective
AAS. All specific submodels are bound to the specific Part Type's context e.g., meaning that each aspect is described
for the specific catalog item on supplier and customer side represented by the AASs.
See [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/category/digital-twin-kit) for more information on
the shared asset approach.

The orange submodels are the submodels used within this standard's context.

The grey submodels are used within
the [Industry Core KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/industry-core-kit) (
_PartTypeInformation, SingleLevelBomAsPlanned, SingleLevelUsageAsPlanned_). Besides PartTypeInformation on
supplier-side, no other models are mandatory. The Bill Of Material (BOM) and usage models can be used to build data
chains, if the partners align to (
see [Industry Core KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/industry-core-kit)). This KIT relies
on the "_Part Type_" life cycle of the Industry Core representing catalog items after sourcing.

The blue dashed lines show the references between DTs based on Catena-X UUIDs and BPNL information that may be resolved
by the Item Relationship Service (
see [Industry Core KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/industry-core-kit), [Data Chain KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/category/data-chain-kit)
and [Traceability KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/category/traceability-kit)).

The shared asset approach shown in figure 2 is one of the patterns described in the Digital Twin KIT. It preserves the
sovereignty by provisioning the aspect on on the owning partner's side creating a common view on the asset. A shared
asset approach is needed whenever the customer provides data for a part type digital twin. The following implications
apply:

- The supplier generates the Catena-X ID and provides the aspect model _PartTypeInformation_ while the customer reuses
  the generated Catena-X ID for his digital twin representation (see Industry Core KIT).
- If only the supplier would provide the Planned Production Output, no digital twin representation would be needed on
  the customer-side.
- Also if only the customer provides information (e.g. Short-Term Material Demand), the supplier needs to create the
  digital twin first so that the customer can create his representation.
- While one supplier side twin can be created to handle multiple customers, a customer must create the representation of
  the specific twin per supplier - also if it's the same part type from customer point of view.

Note: from business point of view a quid-pro-quo principle of exchanged information is recommended (stock for stock,
production for demand, delivery information as needed based inco term, days of supply for days of supply).

## Policies

This chapter describes the access & usage policies as well as the contract definitions. For more information on the
access & usage policies, please refer to
the [policies documentation in the tractusx-edc repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/blob/main/docs/usage/management-api-walkthrough/02_policies.md)

### Access Policies

To enable data sovereignty, access and usage policies are important to protect the data assets of a data provider in the
connector, as described in
the [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/connector-kit).

To decide which company has access to the data assets, access policy should be used. Note that without protecting data
assets with access policies, they become publicly available in the Catena-X network which is not recommended.

Therefore, every asset should be protected and only be made available through specified BPNL policy groups or specific
BPNL policies. For a detailed description,
see [Business Partner Validation Extension](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/tree/main/edc-extensions/bpn-validation).

#### BPNL Access Policy

This policy allows limiting access to a data offer based on a list of specific BPNLs. This translates to the following
functionality:

- The data offer creator will be able to create a policy listing all the BPN that can access the data offer.
- This means that only the connectors registered in the Catena-X network with the BPNL listed in the policy can see the
  data offer and accept it (for the creation of data contracts and subsequent data exchange).

#### Implementation Hint

Examples including a JSON payload for a BPNL group access policy are described in
the [Business Partner Validation Extension](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/tree/main/edc-extensions/bpn-validation).

This reference implementation also provides an extension to add the BPNL of the requesting party to the header of a
proxied request. As a result, during implementation one can use this bpnl to design the internal submodel api design.

### Usage Policies

To decide which company can use the data asset under specific conditions, usage policies (also referred to as contract
policies) are used. Therefore, they are more specific than access policies and only used just after access is granted.
Currently, the usage policies aren't technically enforced but based on a legal framework agreements. Signing of
framework agreements can be enforced during negotiation depending on the connector implementation.

Policies are defined based on the [W3C ODRL format](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/). This allows a standardized way
of formulating policy payloads. It further allows to stack different constraints with the `odrl:and` operator.
Therefore, every data provider can decide on his or her own under which conditions their data assets are shared in the
network. It is recommended to restrict the data usage for all exchanged data standards. An example of one usage policy
containing three different constraints is shown and described in the following:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    {
      "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
      "cx-policy": "https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/"
    }
  ],
  "@type": "PolicyDefinitionRequestDto",
  "@id": "<POLICY-ID>", // Important for the contract definition
  "edc:policy": {
    "@type": "Set",
    "profile": "cx-policy:profile2405",
    "permission": [
      {
        "action": "use",
        "constraint": {
          "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
          "and": [
            {
              "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
              "leftOperand": "cx-policy:FrameworkAgreement",
              "operator": "eq",
              "rightOperand": "Puris:1.0"
            },
            {
              "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
              "leftOperand": "cx-policy:UsagePurpose",
              "operator": "eq",
              "rightOperand": "cx.puris.base:1"
            },
            {
              "@type": "LogicalConstraint",
              "leftOperand": "cx-policy:ContractReference",
              "operator": "eq",
              "rightOperand": "x12345"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

PURIS relies on the usage purpose [cx.puris.base:1](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile/blob/main/profile.md),
used in the example above. It's purpose is related to "_Optimizing processes, which includes, without limitation,
regular exchange of data to prevent and/or solve shortages in the supply chain, conducting plausibility checks against
other sources and/or collecting information to facilitate sound decision making, all of the above in the context of
predictive unit real-time information relating to production and/or logistics._"

More information can be found in
the [Policies in Catena-X of the Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/connector-kit/adoption-view_policies_cx/).

### Contract Definitions

In the connector, every policy is associated with a contract. Thus, a contract definition is needed, detailing what
policies are required when contracting assets.

When using an above mentioned Access Policy, their `ACCESS_POLICY_ID` needs to be included as a value of
the `accessPolicyId` key in the contract definition.

When using an above mentioned Usage Policy, their `CONTRACT_POLICY_ID` needs to be included as a value of
the `contractPolicyId` key in the contract definition.

```json
{
  "id": "{{CONTRACT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
  "criteria": [
    {
      "operandLeft": "asset:prop:id",
      "operator": "=",
      "operandRight": "{{ASSET_ID}}"
    }
  ],
  "accessPolicyId": "{{ACCESS_POLICY_ID}}",
  "contractPolicyId": "{{CONTRACT_POLICY_ID}}"
}
```

For a more detailed tutorial on creating contracts for assets, see
in [Chapter 3 of the End-to-End Adopter Journey](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/tutorials/e2e/boost/provideData).

## Protocol

This chapter contains data structures that are designed for providing data in the PURIS standards.

The PURIS KIT does not define its own protocol, as it is using the communication pattern described in
the [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/kits/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/interaction-patterns)
and relies on
the [Part Type Twin definitions of the Industry Core KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/industry-core-kit/software-development-view/Digital%20Twins%20Development%20View%20Industry%20Core%20Kit).

Examples of how the required data structures for that pattern may look like for PURIS are described in this chapter.

### Connector Data Asset Structure

To allow partners to find data regarding a specific Industry Core Part Type Twin, the provider has to register a
connector data asset (see [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/connector-kit))
specifying the address of the Digital Twin Registry of the provider (
see [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/kits/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/interaction-patterns)).

The structure is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
    "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
    "dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  },
  "@id": "{{CONNECTOR_ASSET_ID}}", // defined by yourself
  "properties": {
    "dct:type": { "@id": "cx-taxo:DigitalTwinRegistry" },
    "cx-common:version": "3.0"
  },
  "privateProperties": {},
  "dataAddress": {
    "@type": "DataAddress",
    "type": "HttpData",
    "baseUrl": "{{ DIGITAL_TWIN_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT }}",
    "proxyQueryParams": "true",
    "proxyBody": "false",
    "proxyPath": "true",
    "proxyMethod": "false"
  }
}
```

The property **_@id_** must uniquely identify the connector data asset.

Other fields are predetermined by the used standard and protocol.

### Connector Data Asset Structure for "Submodel"

In order to allow partners to receive the actual aspect model data (e.g. Item Stock,
see [all PURIS semantic models](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/puris-kit/adoption-view#semantic-models)),
the provider has to register a connector data asset (
see [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/connector-kit)) specifying the address of
the submodel endpoint (
see [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/digital-twin-kit)) providing the
actual data.

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
    "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
    "dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
    "aas-semantics": "https://admin-shell.io/aas/3/0/HasSemantics/"
  },
  "@id": "{{CONNECTOR_ASSET_ID}}", // defined by yourself
  "properties": {
    "dct:type": { "@id": "cx-taxo:Submodel" },
    "cx-common:version": "3.0",
    "aas-semantics:semanticId": {
      "@id": "urn:samm:io.catenax.item_stock:2.0.0#ItemStock"
    }
  },
  "privateProperties": {},
  "dataAddress": {
    "@type": "DataAddress",
    "type": "HttpData",
    "baseUrl": "{{ SUBMODEL_ENDPOINT }}",
    "proxyQueryParams": "false",
    "proxyBody": "false",
    "proxyPath": "true",
    "proxyMethod": "false"
  }
}
```

The property **_@id_** must uniquely identify the connector data asset.

Other fields are predetermined by the used standard and protocol.

Especially the semantic ID can be found in the Sample Data chapter and has to match the aspect model to be transferred.
Currently the PURIS standards restrict the user to not use the repository approach as the semantic id is mandatory for
the asset.

### Shell Descriptors

The Shell Descriptor defines the metadata of the Industry Core Part Type Twin. The following example Shell Descriptor
represents a the Shell Descriptor of a supplier who provides access to an "_Item Stock_" submodel (
see [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models)) for two customers using the legacy access
control in the Digital Twin Registry reference implementation. For further information on the creation of Part Type
Twins, refer to
the [Digital Twin KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/kits/digital-twin-kit/software-development-view/dt-kit-software-development-view)
and the [Industry Core KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/industry-core-kit).

When searching the data assets catalog of a data provider, a data consumer uses the assetId determined via
subprotocolBody of the Submodel Descriptor's endpoint definition of subprotocol type "DSP" of the Submodel Descriptor of
interest.

The relevant Submodel can be identified based on the semantic Id (see Sample Data chapter).

## Sample Data

The semantic models in the business context are defined in the PURIS Adoption View. This chapter gives additional
information for each aspect model by providing the example data objects in JSON format, link to the RDF turtle file on
GitHub and unique semantic id of the aspect model.

### 1. Item Stock v.2.0.0

GitHub link to semantic data model in RDF turtle
format: [https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.item_stock/2.0.0/ItemStock.ttl](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/8e4b33858008c2bff56885904ce1e1f3cdef59da/io.catenax.item_stock/2.0.0/ItemStock.ttl)

This aspect model has the following semantic id:

```text
urn:samm:io.catenax.item_stock:2.0.0#ItemStock

This aspect model has the following semantic id:

```json
urn:samm:io.catenax.short_term_material_demand:1.0.0#ShortTermMaterialDemand
```

**Example 1:** A demand quantity of 180 pieces with a demand category "series" and a demand quantity of 100 pieces with
demand category "after-sales" for a material with Catena-X ID "urn:uuid:48878d48-6f1d-47f5-8ded-a441d0d879df". The
customer location varies for the different demand series. This Short-Term Material Demand is the demand that a supplier
received from a customer.

```json

GitHub link to semantic data model in RDF turtle
format: [https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/io.catenax.delivery_information/2.0.0/DeliveryInformation.ttl](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/8e4b33858008c2bff56885904ce1e1f3cdef59da/io.catenax.delivery_information/2.0.0/DeliveryInformation.ttl)

This aspect model has the following semantic id:

```text
urn:samm:io.catenax.delivery_information:2.0.0#DeliveryInformation
```

The JSONs snippets below provide an example of the value-only serialization of the "_DeliveryInformation_" aspect model
for three different delivery situations:

1. A not yet departed delivery - estimated departure and arrival dates
2. A delivery in transit - actual departure and estimated arrival dates
3. A delivery with actual arrival times - actual departure and arrival dates

**Example 1:** The order has not yet departed from its origin, as is indicated by the estimated values for both
departure and arrival (see transitEvents property). This is an example of estimated delivery.

```json
{
  "materialGlobalAssetId": "urn:uuid:48878d48-6f1d-47f5-8ded-a441d0d879df",
  "positions": [

        "customerOrderId": "C-Nbr-4711",
        "customerOrderPositionId": "PositionId-01"
      },
      "deliveries": [
        {
          "lastUpdatedOnDateTime": "2023-04-28T14:23:00.123456+14:00",
          "deliveryQuantity": {
            "value": 20.0,
            "unit": "unit:piece"
          },
          "transitEvents": [
            {
              "dateTimeOfEvent": "2023-04-01T14:23:00+01:00",
              "eventType": "estimated-departure"
            },
            {
              "dateTimeOfEvent": "2023-04-05T14:23:00+01:00",
              "eventType": "estimated-arrival"
            }
          ],
          "trackingNumber": "1Z9829WDE02128",
          "incoterm": "EXW",
          "transitLocations": {
            "destination": {

              "bpnaProperty": "BPNA0000002082ZZ"
            },
            "origin": {
              "bpnsProperty": "BPNS0000000185ZZ",
              "bpnaProperty": "BPNA0000001982ZZ"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example 2:** The status of this delivery is currently in transit, denoted by the actual departure and estimated
arrival values (see transitEvents property).

```json
{
  "materialGlobalAssetId": "urn:uuid:48878d48-6f1d-47f5-8ded-a441d0d879df",

        "customerOrderPositionId": "PositionId-01"
      },
      "deliveries": [
        {

          },
          "transitEvents": [
            {
              "dateTimeOfEvent": "2023-04-01T14:23:00+01:00",
              "eventType": "actual-departure"
            },
            {
              "dateTimeOfEvent": "2023-04-05T14:23:00+01:00",
              "eventType": "estimated-arrival"
            }
          ],
          "trackingNumber": "1Z9829WDE02128",
          "incoterm": "EXW",
          "transitLocations": {
            "destination": {
              "bpnsProperty": "BPNS0000000410ZZ",
              "bpnaProperty": "BPNA0000002082ZZ"

            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example 3:** As seen from the actual departure and actual arrival values (see transitEvents property), this is an
example of a completed delivery.

```json
{
  "materialGlobalAssetId": "urn:uuid:48878d48-6f1d-47f5-8ded-a441d0d879df",

        "customerOrderPositionId": "PositionId-01"
      },
      "deliveries": [
        {

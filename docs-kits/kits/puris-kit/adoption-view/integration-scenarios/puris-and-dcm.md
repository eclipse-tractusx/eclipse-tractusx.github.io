title: Supply Chain Resiliency with PURIS and DCM
description: Integrated Perspective on Supply Chain Resiliency with PURIS and DCM
sidebar_position: 1

Catena-X enables comprehensive transparency across the entire supply network while maintaining sensitive data handling between partners by extending beyond the four-week planning horizon of PURIS.
In this context, DCM and PURIS complement each other with the shared goal of avoiding capacity bottlenecks or supply shortages.

However, due to their respective time focuses, both standards emphasize different types of information. While DCM primarily considers capacities at the material group level with weekly demand and capacity buckets, PURIS focuses on daily production and supply and demand data at the single material number level.

- Where does it stand in relation to other standards like Demand and Capacity Management (DCM)?
- How can DCM and PURIS work together to enhance supply chain transparency?
- How can data be shared in complex supply chains?
- How to consume or provide information in case of single or multiple suppliers or customers?

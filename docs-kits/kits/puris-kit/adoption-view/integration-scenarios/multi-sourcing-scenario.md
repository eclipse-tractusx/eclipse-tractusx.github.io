In a multi-sourcing scenario, the same material or product is procured from multiple suppliers. While the internal handling of the material — such as storage or production use — may be unified, companies must ensure that data related to demand and item stock can be clearly attributed to the respective supplier.

In cases where supplier-specific information is maintained separately (e.g., through batch tracking or source-specific labeling), data provisioning is relatively straightforward. The origin of materials can be identified and shared without major transformation.

In practice, this means that demand planning and inventory management are handled jointly, making it infeasible to assign data to a specific supplier context. Nevertheless, the data exchanged using this KIT must still be prepared and structured in a way that complies with applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements — even if a clear technical separation is not possible.

## Introduction to the Use Case

The Behavior Twin MDP (Model and Data Processing) Application stands as a enables development within the framework of the Catena-X initiative, aimed at colaborative  utilization of behavioral digital twins are the automotive industry. This innovative application is poised to define the workflow and the tool chain for the  model-based system development and data processing, leveraging Catena-X technology and collaborative principles. The mission of the Behavior Twin MDP Application is to provide a comprehensive framework for the selection o, integration, and utilization of behavioral digital twins. Through adherence to Catena-X standards and principles, we strive to ensure secure data exchange, interoperability, and compatibility, laying the foundation for seamless collaboration and innovation.

Enhance model based design using models coming from component suppliers(for example: the OEM gets the models of the gear box, the brakes and the battery from the respective Tier1) . Facilitate model exchange between Tier1s and OEM or between Tier2s and Tier1. This is done using the industry standard FMU (which is a black box model so the intellectual property is protected) and performing the exchange over EDC. Our Use case then provides the tools to combine the models and perform parametric studies.Â 

## General Information Display: Behavior Twin MDP Application

The General Information Display the description of the Behavior Twin MDP (Model and Data Processing) Application offers users a user-friendly interface to visualize essential information about behavioral digital twins and their components. Whether users are analyzing the behavior of a component within a vehicle or maintaining a system, this feature provides easy access to valuable insights.

A technical expert from OEM has to build a design of a new car. The simulation expert will collect the necessary models from the Tier1 and combine them in a vehicle models to evaluate different designs. The models are exchanged between Catena-X partners using EDC and using the FMU format (black box model)

Once the models are available the workflow proceeds in three steps:
Verify that the FMUs are valid (conform to the industry standard). Get informations about the model input/outputs to make sure that you got the right models
Get the model in Simcenter System Architect over Xcelerator Share (which is being connected to EDC). The models are composed in a larger model (called Architecture)
Get the architecture in Simcenter HEEDs and run and compare parametric studies to evaluate the design.

## FMU Checker
FMU checker: to check the model and gain insights (for example what are the input and outputs)
### FMU Checker - Projects overview

The Projects Overview page serves as a hub for managing and monitoring all projects involving FMUs. It offers a centralized view of project statuses, progress, and key metrics, empowering users to stay organized and informed throughout the project lifecycle.

In the past, the Catena-X ecosystem for PCF data exchange consisted exclusively of commercial applications (so-called COTS apps). For release 24.05, with the Simple Data Exchanger (SDE), for the first time an open source solution is announced to support the CX PCF Use Case Standard (data model, API,...). Further information regarding the SDE (usage, configuration and deployment) are published on GitHub:
- [SDE Frontend GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/managed-simple-data-exchanger-frontend)

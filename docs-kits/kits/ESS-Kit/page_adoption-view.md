## Vision & Mission

### Introduction

The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act came into force on 1 January 2023. This law regulates corporate responsibility for compliance with human rights in global supply chains. These include, for example, protection against child labour, the right to fair wages and the protection of the environment. This legislation can be added to a long list of existing and future legislations that regulate our global supply chains, like the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), the EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CRSD), or the International Bill of Human Rights.

Catena-X aims to support supply chain due diligence obligations in a market environment that misses full up- and downstream transparency. This is argued to be relevant for Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) incident tracking, without compromising GAIA-X and Catena-X principles like data sovereignty, interoperability, standardization, and use of federated services.

The ESS-solution enables companies to search for ESS incidents in their supply chain and thus covers the "occasion-related tracking of ESS-related incidents" for the Supply Chain Act. Basically there are two search directions: The bottom - up search starts at the Incident Originator and works downstream up to the OEM. The top - down search always looks towards the direct suppliers and works upstream.

### Vision

As companies governed by environment and social standards (ESS), we would like to determine, if we are affected by an incident reported in the global supply network. Consequently, we could prove to be fully compliant with legal requirements, including but not limited to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.

### Mission

The automotive supply network is described as highly complex and globally interwoven. It operates in a heterogeneous political and environmental context with many different ambitions. The current challenges for cross-company ESS incident management are described by:

- High manual effort of a small set of experts that work in their own silos and focus on company-centric investigation. A problem accentuated at the level of small and medium enterprises (SME),
- Low network collaboration and by that long processing time amongst business partners,
- Lack of trust to share data, amongst many intermediates,
- Varying quality of information and sources.

Our mission is to streamline the handling of incidents reported to the Catena-X network. The ESS KIT supports cross-company ESS incident management with appropriate processes. This radical change from our organization-centred model would mitigate the challenges listed above. The ESS KIT consists of the following building blocks:

- Standards to guarantee data sovereignty and data security, like the Connector KIT (EDC), Business Partner KIT and Agents KIT, as well as our standards,
- Standardized data model accompanied with a defined tracing process to reduce processing time for an incident.

### Business value

If Catena-X members want to minimize their ESS risk and bring transparency into their supply chains, there is a strong need to collect knowledge and reliable information. Arguably, the primary added value of the ESS KIT is our simplified cross-company communication coupled with the clearing agency concept.

With the Clearing agency in place, business partners subscribing to the ESS KIT, can with confidence collect incidents from multiple actors and a broad range of sources (e.g. receiving incidents from company's internal incident management systems or from public news reports and automated information gathering). The clearing agency, as an independent body will among other activities reduce fraudulent cases and consolidate information of potential incidents.

The processes of the ESS KIT will transfer information in the respective supply chains to efficiently zero-in on the relevant business partners. So, with the ESS KIT, the members of the Catena-X network are enabled to act quickly due to collaboration and standardization.

Furthermore, the ESS KIT allows for quick adaptation to new national and internal laws and helps ensure legal compliance through enhanced supply chain transparency and verification.

Thus, the ESS incident KIT offers a uniform and cross-sectoral grievance mechanism for managing incidents related to specific occasions, filling a gap that currently exists.

## Use Case

### Prerequisites

The scope of our business is the prompt handling of incidents reported to the Catena-X network. The following prerequisites are necessary for the ESS KIT:

- High number of Catena-X members need to be onboarded to cover our supply chains and increase the success rate of the tracing of incidents,
- Catena-X members agree to a Code of Conduct,
- The member needs to follow the onboarding process.

### Customer Journey: Occasion-related tracking of ESS-related incidents

This customer journey describes the process when an incident is reported to the Catena-X network. From the determination that needs to be made regarding its relevance to the business partners and further processing.

This KIT support **the detection of incidents** from different sources (manual or automated), before being categorized by incident types / sub-types. The unstructured information (text and/or pictures) about each incident will be collected along with country-, company-, material-related data if available (note: no BoM data collected). The quality of the incident data is not guaranteed at this stage and for some cases, the investigation may be challenging due to insufficient information about the supply network.

The Clearing Agency is prompted to **clear incidents.** This independent body has the tasks among others, to improve quality of data and reduce fraud or fakes. This includes but is not limited to, manual search and input from expert, consolidation of reports of the same incident and finally accept or archive incidents. Once the Clearing Agency found that the incident's originator is a Catena-X member, the Clearing Agency can use Catena-X Services find out the BPN-L, BPN-S and the EDC endpoints of the incident originator. Then the ESS incident is transferred to the incident originator via the Catena-X network. In case no Catena-X member can be identified as incident originator or L0, the clearing agency will maintain the corresponding status "no member found".

The **investigation of the ESS-related incident** is used to determine the cause of the reported incident. All business partners involved work to identify and confirm the origin of the incident. Once the source is identified and confirmed, a decision is made by the business partners whether to accept or reject the ESS-related incident.

**The trace of an incident** is operated through the decentral Catena-X supply network. The process moves from business partner to business partner in their supply chain with the incident originator as the starting point for a bottom - up approach and at the OEM for a top - down approach.

The use case ESS believes that the most promising way to solve an ESS incident will be a bottom - up approach. This is described here.

It means that the transfer of information is initiated by the L0 who identifies its impacted customers (L1) using the bottom-up search logic (for example Knowledge Agent). The impacted customers (L1) can then push the information down the supply chain (i.e. their impacted customers or L2) and so on until it arrives at the end of the chain (i.e. OEM).

The trace of an incident follows previously mentioned principles along any obligations enforced by law. For any business partner in the supply chain, its access to the status/information related to a specific incident will depend on its degree of relationship with the impacted company:

- **Level 0 (L~0~):** the incident report is targeting the company directly. At that level, the incident manager of the L~0~ can consult all the relevant information and will manage the status and response.

- **Level 1 (L~1~):** those business partners have a direct relationship with the L~0~. As already supported in existing legislations, L~1~ business partners will have access to the status of the incident and the full information of the potential incident at the L~0~.

- **Level n (L~n~):** those business partners have an indirect relationship with the potential incident originator (L~0~). They will receive from the previous business partner (L~n-1~) the anonymized incident information (anonymized title & description, category, status, etc.) along with the degree of relationship (i.e. their distance to the L~0~). The incident originator's identity (L~0~) and the path from L~0~ to L~n~ in the impacted supply chain will not be communicated, nor documented.

- **Clearing Agency:** these users can see the status and the original intake of information of all incidents. The clearing agency will only be able to identify the targeted business partner (L~0~) who is handling the incident. Finally, if the incident can be closed by the L0, the clearing agency will receive a status update.

**Note:** For the top - down approach with IRS recursive this is not applicable because no information about the ESS incident is transferred between Business Partners. See [Data Chain KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/category/data-chain-kit/) for further details.

## Business process

### Business architecture

![ESS_KitBusinessArchitecture](@site/static/kits/ESS-Kit/CatenaX_ESS_KitBusinessArchitecture.png)

### Access & Usage Policies / Code of Conduct

#### Preamble

**Code of Conduct of the Catena-X Use Case Sustainability / Environmental and Social standards:**

In the Catena-X use case sustainability / environmental and social standards, principles are established with the aim of establishing transparent and trustworthy practices within the Catena-X network.
These principles are based on national and international legal regulations and are aligned with internationally recognised standards such as the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, as well as the ILO core labour standards and the principles of the UN Global Compact.
Accordingly, this document defines the minimum requirements and clear expectations for the corporate due diligence obligations of the members. We expect you, as our member, to ensure that these requirements and expectations are also passed on appropriately to your downstream business partners. Acting responsibly and lawfully is therefore an integral part of participating in the Catena-X network.
The Catena-X network includes companies and organizations that design, manufacture, market or provide goods and services for the automotive industry. The Code of Conduct must be adopted by every company participating in the Catena-X Use Case Sustainability / Environmental and Social Standards in a binding manner or guaranteed by an appropriate standard of its own. The recognition of the Catena-X Code of Conduct is the basis of a cooperative business relationship with our members.  Given the complexity and dynamics of the n-tier network, we rely on joint activities with all our members to identify risks to the environment and society, create more transparency and achieve more effectiveness.
The Catena-X Use Case Sustainability / Environmental and Social Standards participants should consider the Code as a comprehensive supply chain initiative. A prerequisite for membership is conducting business activities in full compliance with the law.
The Code also encourages participants to go beyond legal compliance and rely on internationally recognized standards to promote social and environmental responsibility and business ethics, for example by increasing their own sphere of influence through complementary measures or collaborations, and by encouraging collaboration with non-governmental organizations.
The Catena-X Use Case Sustainability / Environmental and Social Standards is committed to regularly engaging with stakeholders in the ongoing development and implementation of the Code of Conduct.
The Code consists of three sections. Section I contains the requirements for Catena-X members. Section II describes the proposed implementation of the Catena-X Code of Conduct. Section III refers to the elements of an acceptable system that complies with this Code of Conduct.

#### I Requirements for Catena-X members

The following requirements for Catena-X members are derived, among other things, from the internationally recognized guiding principles.

#### 1 Responsible Business practices

Acting responsibly and in accordance with the law is an integral part of our values. The basic requirement is consistently lawful business activity. The Catena-X member must comply with all legal requirementsto its product and operations, including those of national and international standards regarding sustainability, environmental protection, ethical management, and respect for human rights.

#### 2 Social Responsibility

For Catena-X the social responsibility towards employees and other potential stakeholders is of utmost importance. The Catena-X member must therefore take appropriate precautions to avoid committing and participating in human rights violations. Catena-X rejects any threatening and defaming of people who advocate for the protection of human rights at the supplier and address human rights violations (human rights defenders), and it also expects its suppliers to guarantee their protection where necessary.

##### 2.1 Prohibition of forced labor and slavery

The Catena-X member must ensure that forced labor and modern slavery are prevented in their own business area and with business partners. In specific terms, this includes:

- Labor or service required of a person under threat of punishment and for which he or she has not volunteered (including ILO C29) and
- all forms of slavery, slave-like practices (e.g., demanding excessive fees and withholding documents), servitude, or other forms of domination or oppression (e.g., debt bondage and use of force) in the workplace environment, such as through extreme economic or sexual exploitation or humiliation.

Catena-X prohibits any form of forced or compulsory labor, including debt bondage, human trafficking and any other form of modern slavery in accordance with ILO Convention No. 29. Catena-X members shall ensure that their employees have the freedom to choose their employment and can terminate their employment in accordance with legal requirements and receive all due payments. Employees must not be subjected to debt bondage or financial burdens. This also applies to employees of their business partners.

##### 2.2 Prohibition of child labour

The Catena-X member must ensure that child labor and the worst forms of child labor are prevented according to ILO conventions in their own business area and with business partners and undertake to comply with the following requirements:

- Prohibition of the worst forms of child labour (including ILO C182).
- The minimum age for employment is in accordance with the requirements of the national law of the supplier location and is at least 15 years (including ILO 138).
- Persons under the age of 18 are minors and therefore in need of protection (including ILO C182). They shall not perform work which, due to its nature or the circumstances in which it is performed, would endanger their safety, health or moral, for example, by working overtime or night shifts (including ILO C138).

##### 2.3 Freedom of association and right to collective bargaining

The Catena-X member recognizes the right of employees to form employee representative bodies and to bargain collectively to regulate working conditions. In its operations, the Catena-X member must uphold the right of employees to join trade unions.
Establishing, joining, or becoming a member of a trade union must not be used as a reason for unjustified discrimination or retaliation.
Unions shall be allowed to operate freely and in accordance with the law of the place of employment. This includes the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining.  The Catena-X member must also exclude the use of security forces to interfere with freedom of association.

##### 2.4 Protection against discrimination

The Catena-X member does not tolerate discrimination in any form. The general prohibition of discrimination in Article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 19 December 1966 provides guidance. Unequal treatment in employment, for example due to national or ethnic origin, social origin, language, pregnancy, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, age, gender, trade union membership, political opinion, religion, belief, or other characteristics protected by applicable law (including ILO C111) must be prevented. Unequal treatment also includes, in particular, the payment of unequal remuneration for work of equal value.

##### 2.5 Right to adequate remuneration

The Catena-X member must ensure that the remuneration paid to employees complies with all applicable wage laws, including those related to minimum wages, overtime, and statutory benefits. In specific terms, this means that:

- The wage shall be at least in accordance with the locally applicable minimum wage regulations and in any case shall be a living wage.
- Wages shall be paid in a traceable manner and at a specified time in accordance with ILO 95.
- Compliance with legal working time regulations and compensation of overtime. Social benefits can be claimed by employees with applicable laws (e.g., sick leave).
If statutory social insurance exists, payment of the contributions shall be mandatory.

We encourage Catena-X members to ensure employee representation in the regulation of working hours or at least to adequately consider the needs of employees  in the organization of working hours.

##### 2.6 Right to health and safety in the workplace

The Catena-X member must comply with all national and international standards and laws on occupational safety (in particular safety at work, health protection, working hours) that apply to its location of business.  Furthermore, the working hours must be organized in such a way that occupational accidents due to physical and mental fatigue are avoided and the health of employees is maintained (ILO 1, ILO 14).. This principle also encompasses temporary agency work, the secondment of employees, and outsourced work.

##### 2.7 Rights of local communities

The Catena-X member respects applicable local, national, international and traditional rights concerning land, water, and resources. In particular, the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities shall be respected and protected throughout the supply chain in accordance with the *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples*.
The Catena-X member agrees not to participate in land grabbing. The Catena-X member must also follow the prohibition of unlawful eviction of land, forests and waters. This applies if he acquires, cultivates or otherwise uses land, forests and waters that serve as a livelihood of a person. Rather, the Catena-X member must obtain free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) from existing land users, for example as defined in the UN-REDD program: reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries (REDD), and provide adequate compensation if the supplier has been granted land use.

#### 3 Ecological responsibility

For the Catena-X member, responsibility toward the environment means protecting the finite resources of nature. Therefore, the careful and efficient use of resources is of the utmost importance.
The Catena-X member must comply with all national and international environmental standards and laws applicable that apply to its location of business.  We also expect the Catena-X member to refrain harmful changes to the soil, water and air pollution, harmful noise emissions or excess water consumption that significantly impair the natural foundations for the cultivation and the production of food, prevent people from accessing safe drinking water, impair or inhibit access to sanitary facilities, or are harmful to health.

##### 3.1 Decarbonization

The Catena-X member must advance the decarbonization of the entire value chain. The emission reduction targets, and renewable energy targets are to be implemented in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement (COP 21) and appropriate binding measures are to be taken.

##### 3.2 Resource conservation and circular economy

The Catena-X member must refrain waste and ensure responsible handling of resources such as water, energy, raw materials and materials. We also expect the Catena-X member to qualify their own n-tier supply chains with regard to the provision of secured secondary raw material sources, and to evaluate that secondary raw materials are used to the greatest extent possible. This also includes, for example, establishing closed loops for returning recyclable materials into the supplier’s own supply chain.

##### 3.3 Handling hazardous substances and waste

The Catena-X member applies appropriate procedures that take into account environmental, health and safety aspects. Therefore, the Catena-X member must label these materials in accordance with the applicable regulations and shall guarantee that they are handled, transported, and stored safely. They must also ensure that such materials are reused, recycled, or disposed of properly.

The provisions from the following conventions are to be adhered to:

- the Minamata Convention (use of mercury),
- the Stockholm Convention (on persistent organic pollutants) and
- the Basel Convention (on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste and their disposal).

Furthermore, all other laws and specifications concerning hazardous materials, chemicals, and substances that apply to the business location and/or the market in question (e.g., European Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (REACH)) are to be complied with.
We also expect that the Catena-X member and its suppliers, regardless of whether they are members of Catena-X or not, will inform themselves about future laws that will apply to them and to prepare for their timely implementation.

##### 3.4 Protection of biodiversity

The Catena-X member must protect natural ecosystems and must not contribute to the changing, deforestation and damage to natural forests and other natural ecosystems. The guidelines of the High Conservation Value Resource Network (HCV) and the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) should be applied where applicable.

##### 3.5 Animal welfare

The Catena-X member that processes animal products must ensure the implementation of standards and best practice methods for compliance with animal welfare along the entire supply chain. Furthermore, we expect the Catena-X members to give preference to alternative methods that do not involve animal testing, except where required by law. In any case, the Catena-X member must follow the national and international rules regarding animal protection and animal testing.

In addition, we demand compliance with further principles:

- The 3R principle regarding animal testing (reduction, refinement, replacement),
- the Five Freedoms of the Animal Welfare Committee (AWC) as a criterion to access  animal welfare, and
- the standards for the improvement of animal health and welfare (Terrestrial Animal Health Code) of the World Organisation for Animal Health.

##### 3.6 Responsible procurement of raw materials and minerals

The Catena-X member must establish special due diligence processes in accordance with the *OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict- Affected and High-Risk Areas* for the following raw materials: tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (the so-called 3TG) from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).
The Catena-X member shall source raw materials from verified sources. We encourage the Catena-X member the Catena-X member to to obtain certification by an independent third party, such as the Responsible Mining Standard of the *Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance* (IRMA). Furthermore, if relevant, we recommend participating in multi-stakeholder initiatives (e.g., *Responsible Minerals Initiative*) that aim to establish the standards defined in this document in raw material supply chains.

#### 4 Implementation of corporate duty of care

Accordingly, the Catena-X member, must align its business and procurement activities with these principles and address them appropriately along its supply chain.
We expect the Catena-X member to has established or is implementing a due diligence process with appropriate measuresto ensure that its suppliers and subcontractors, in turn, also comply with  the  standards are adhered to, e.g., implementation of the Code of Conduct of the *Responsible Business Alliance* (RBA) or the Guiding principles of the *Drive sustainability partnership*.

To promote the implementation of this Code of Conduct, we expect the Catena-X member to take the following actions:

**Risk management**: We expect that the Catena-X member implements an appropriate and effective management system for corporate due diligence toward people and the environment in its organization as well as with its direct suppliers. This includes but is not limited to contractual agreements, a supplier policy for sustainable procurement, and audits  or other suitable measures to prevent or minimize these risks or to end the violation of human rights-related or environmental obligations.

The Catena-X member shall adequately address sustainability requirements in accordance with this code of conduct to its direct business partners that include at least the following topics:
Prohibition of child labor; young workers; wages and benefits; working hours; prohibition of modern slavery; freedom of association and collective bargaining; non-discrimination and harassment; women’s rights; diversity, equity, and inclusion; rights of minorities and indigenous peoples; land, forest, and water rights and forced eviction; health and safety; anticorruption and anti-money laundering; data protection and data security; financial responsibility; disclosure of information; fair competition and antitrust law; conflicts of interest; counterfeit parts; intellectual property; export controls and economic sanctions; whistleblowing and protection against retaliation; responsible chemical management; sustainable resource management; waste reduction; biodiversity, land use and deforestation; soil quality.

**Notification and remedy mechanisms**: If a Catena-X member becomes aware that there has been a violation of the requirements of the Code of Conduct within its own business operations or supply chain, it must promptly take appropriate corrective measures. At its own discretion, the Catena-X member will immediately inform Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. about confirmed violations in its own business operations or supply chain against the obligations of this standard or any related regulatory investigation. This follows the principle of "sharing is caring". Upon becoming aware of a violation, the Catena-X member will, at its own discretion, promptly inform its affected customers or suppliers and, after appropriate review, share all relevant information regarding a substantiated violation and actively request their cooperation, following the "need-to-know" principle. In the case of a very serious violation or a violation of the prohibition of forced and child labor, there is no room for discretion.

**Effectiveness**: The Catena-X Member shall take reasonable measures to prevent or minimize human rights or environmental risks or to end the violation of human rights or environmental obligations and to eliminate or mitigate its consequences. The appropriateness is determined by the member's business activities, by his power of influence, by the severity of the injury to be expected, its reversibility and probability as well as by the type of causal contribution. In principle, the agreement and implementation of measures are the responsibility of the respective company. Nevertheless, it may be advisable and necessary for the Catena-X member to initiate the bundling of interest groups (potentially also affected companies, non-governmental organizations, trade unions, politics, as well as potentially affected persons) on an event-related basis. Pooling resources and creating transparency increases the potential to derive and establish effective measures.

**Further development and support**: Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. acknowledges that the implementation of the duty of care described here is a dynamic process. Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. offers support to the Catena-X member in the implementation of human rights due diligence and in ensuring human rights standards through e.g. information, training and constructive exchange.
This clause does not establish any legal claim to specific support measures by the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. community.

#### II Implementation of the Catena-X Code of Conduct

The requirements for Catena-X members are based on national and international standards and laws. The Catena-X Code of Conduct for the Use Case Environmental and Social Standards describes the requirements and expectations for audit and information rights, effectiveness, reporting options, handling infringements and liability towards third parties as follows:

##### 1 Audit and information rights

On an ad hoc basis, the Code of Conduct requires collaboration of the Catena-X member and its business partners in order to trace an incident with the aim of minimizing the risk and ideally eliminating it.
Upon request, the Catena-X member shall fully and truthfully answer questions to the Committee on Environmental and Social Standards in the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. about compliance with its obligations under this Standard, including its actions, any violations, and complaints. The Catena-X member must also provide relevant documentation upon request and nominate contacts for inquiries. When requesting information, the committee of the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. complies with all applicable laws and regulations, especially those of data protection.

Within the scope of its possibilities, the Catena-X member must arrange for its business partners to provide other affected Catena-X participants in the supply network with the information they need to implement their legal duty of care in their supply chain.

##### 2 Effectiveness

The Catena-X member regularly reviews the effectiveness of the measures they have taken as a company. In doing so, the Catena-X members implemented the aforementioned entrepreneurial duty of care in the cooperation and support of the Catena-X network. The Catena-X business partners must regularly inform each other about the status of implementation or addressing of these obligations at their suppliers and thus adhere to the *need-to-know* and *sharing is caring* principles.

##### 3 Reporting options

The ESS KIT is the base for a complaint mechanism that could be reached in the event of (potential) violations of the above requirements by Catena-X members.

##### 4 Handling of violations

The Catena-X members ensure that persons who have filed a complaint via the complaint mechanism described in the ESS KIT will not suffer any disadvantages. In particular, persons who have filed a complaint may not be dismissed on the basis of the complaint, passed over in the case of promotions, transferred, deployed in lower positions, excluded from training, obliged to perform special work or deployed at a lower wage. The principle applies that the aforementioned protection against disadvantages only applies to persons who have acted to the best of their knowledge and belief in relation to your complaint.
The Catena-X member is required by law to establish a complaint mechanism that allows people in the supply chain to be made aware of possible violations of human rights.

##### 5 Liability towards third parties

All Catena-X members of the Catena-X Automotive network as well as all Catena-X business partners bear sole responsibility for the duties incumbent upon them. If one party breaches its obligations, this shall not relieve the other party from fulfilling its obligations.

#### III Elements of the Catena-X ESS system standards

The system implementation must take into account the Catena-X principles for an open, data-sovereign, standardized and decentralized network. The data exchange for the environmental and social standards use case takes place exclusively between the respective network partners (*one-up/one-down* principle). The possible incidents are distributed to the potentially affected Catena-X members via the supply network on an event-by-event basis and processed there. For this purpose, the greatest possible participation of companies in the automotive supply chain in the Catena-X data ecosystem is to be striven for and required. By participating in the Catena-X data ecosystem [DS1], the companies undertake to ensure the capability of their systems, IT infrastructure, organization and employees.

The current technical descriptions and solution architecture are described and documented in the Eclipse Tractus-X GitHub project.

Furthermore, reference is made to the current Catena-X standards. These are located in the Catena-X standard library.

## Standards

### List of standards

To participate in the ESS Incident Management use-case, the following single standards must be fulfilled and can be consulted in the [Catena-X Standard Library](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library):

- CX-0001 EDC Discovery API

### ESS incidents Data model

- [CX-0144 Use case standards for ESS including the ESS data model](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library)

**Note:** For a top - down approach with IRS, an ESS incident does not have to exist in the form of the ESS Incident Data Model. The following parameters are sufficient for an ESS investigation:

- Catena-X ID of the product whose supply chain is to be investigated
- BPNS (Business Partner Number Site) of the company under investigation

Nevertheless an investigation should be triggered only for an ESS incident occasion - related search.

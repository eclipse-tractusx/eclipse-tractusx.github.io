## Keeping Your System Secure

### Cryptographic Standards

The Data Trust & Security KIT relies on proven cryptographic methods:

- **Digital Signatures**: Uses Ed25519 and RSA to keep credentials secure
- **Key Management**: Keys are generated, stored, and rotated securely
- **Hash Functions**: SHA3-512 helps verify data integrity
- **Encryption**: AES-256 protects sensitive information

### Privacy Protection

Privacy is built into the KIT from the start:

- **Selective Disclosure**: Only the necessary credential attributes are revealed
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: You can verify data without exposing the details
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process what’s needed
- **Consent Management**: Users have clear control over data processing

### Threat Modeling

Here’s how the KIT tackles key security threats:

| Threat | Mitigation | Implementation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Credential Forgery | Cryptographic signatures | Digital signature verification |
| Man-in-the-Middle | TLS encryption | HTTPS enforcement |
| Replay Attacks | Timestamp validation | Credential expiration checks |
| Key Compromise | Key rotation | Regular key updates |
| Revocation Bypass | Revocation checking | Real-time status verification |

## Deployment Patterns

### Centralized Deployment

In a centralized approach:

- **Governance Entity** manages the trusted list
- **Core Service Providers** host verification services
- **Simplified Management** with single point of control
- **Suitable for** initial deployments and smaller networks

## Integration Guidelines

### Integration with Digital Twin Registry

The KIT integrates seamlessly with Digital Twin Registry:

    participant App as Application
    participant VerifyService as Verification Service Wallet
    participant DTR as Digital Twin Registry
    participant SS as Submodel Service
    participant TrustedList as Trusted List
    
    App->>DTR: Query for Digital Twin via Dataplane Proxy
    DTR->>App: Return Twin with Submodel Credentials via Dataplane Proxy
    App->>SS: Get Verifiable Credential in Submodel via Dataplane Proxy
    SS->>App: Veriable Credential via Dataplane Proxy
    App->>VerifyService: Verify Credentials
    VerifyService->>TrustedList: Check Issuer Status
    TrustedList->>VerifyService: Return Issuer Status
    VerifyService->>App: Return Verification Result
```

## Best Practices

### For Issuers

- **Regular Key Rotation**: Implement automated key rotation schedules
- **Data Validation**: Thoroughly validate data before credential issuance
- **Revocation Management**: Maintain up-to-date revocation lists
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular self-audits against accreditation requirements

### For Verifiers

- **Always Check Revocation**: Never skip revocation status checks
- **Validate Issuer Status**: Ensure issuer is currently trusted
- **Implement Caching**: Cache verification results appropriately
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of verification failures

### For Implementers

- **Security First**: Prioritize security in all implementation decisions
- **Standard Compliance**: Adhere to established W3C and Catena-X standards
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring and audit logging
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for all integrations

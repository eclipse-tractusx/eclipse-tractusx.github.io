## Enabling SAMM Standardized Aspect Models with Verifiable Credentials

In order to enable the Eclipse Tractus-X Semantic Models to be used in Verifiable Credentials there is the need to generate JSON-LD "@context" for the data format.

Therefore, for making these two technologies compatible, it is necessary to make a translation from the standard JSON Schemas to the JSON-LD "@context" for the desired aspect models.

## Creating the @context

The solution is to create automatic translation between these standards:

This diagram shows the current incompatibility:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    VC["Verifiable Credentials"] -- USE --> JLD["JSON-LD"]
    JLD["JSON-LD"]  -- REQUIRES --> JLDC["@context"]
    SAMM["SAMM"] -- GENERATES NO --> JLDC["@context"]
    SM["TX Semantic Models"] -- ARE MODELLED IN --> SAMM["SAMM"]
    SAMM["SAMM"] -- GENERATES --> JSS["JSON SCHEMA"]
    JSS["JSON-SCHEMA"] -- CAN BE TRANSLATED TO --> JLDC["@context"]
```

The reality is:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SM["Tractus-X Data Models"] x--NOT COMPATIBLE WITHOUT TRANSLATION --x VC["Verifiable Credentials"]
```

### The Translation Solution

We solve this by automatically converting SAMM JSON schemas into JSON-LD contexts:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SJS["SAMM JSON Schema"] --> SCT["Schema Parser Tool"]:::big
    SCT --> JLD["JSON-LD Context"]
    
    classDef big stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
```

This tool acts as a translator, taking the data validation rules from SAMM and converting them into the semantic context that Verifiable Credentials need.

## The Translation Tool

A SAMM JSON Schema to JSON-LD Context translator is available at the [Eclipse Tractus-X SDK](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-sdk/tree/main) and can be used in the following way:

In a terminal run this:

```shell
pip install tractusx_sdk
```

Now create a script that executes this:

```python

import json
from tractusx_sdk.extensions.semantics import SammSchemaContextTranslator

translator = SammSchemaContextTranslator()

result = translator.schema_to_jsonld(semantic_id="urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:7.0.0#Pcf")
output_file = "pcf_jsonld_context.json"
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(result, f, indent=2)

```

:::info
Please note that the JSON Schema will be automatically fetched from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/main/` to the respective semantic id JSON schema generated in the `gen` folder from each model.

It can be changed by other introducing the `json schema` like this

```python
result = translator.schema_to_jsonld(schema={...}, semantic_id="urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:7.0.0#Pcf")
```

or by introducing another `source url` to retrieve the models according to the SAMM namespace structure:

```python
result = translator.schema_to_jsonld(link_core="https://...", semantic_id="urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:7.0.0#Pcf")
```

## Implementation Examples

### PCF Context Generation Example

Here's how the `sammSchemaParser` generates a JSON-LD context for a Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) semantic model:

```python
# Example usage for PCF semantic model
parser = sammSchemaParser()

# SAMM semantic ID for PCF model
semantic_id = "urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:7.0.0#Pcf"

# JSON Schema generated by SAMM
pcf_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "specVersion": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Version of the specification"
        },
        "companyIds": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "string"},
            "description": "Company identifiers"
        },
        "pcf": {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/PcfDetails",
            "description": "Product Carbon Footprint details"
        }
    },
    "definitions": {
        "PcfDetails": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "pcfExcludingBiogenic": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "PCF excluding biogenic emissions"
                },
                "fossilGhgEmissions": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Fossil GHG emissions"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# Generate JSON-LD context
context = parser.schema_to_jsonld(semantic_id, pcf_schema)
```

### Generated JSON-LD Context

The parser would generate the following JSON-LD context:

```json
{
    "@context": {
        "@version": 1.1,
        "schema": "https://schema.org/",
        "aspect": "urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:7.0.0#",
        "id": "@id",

                },
                "companyIds": {
                    "@id": "aspect:companyIds",
                    "@container": "@list",
                    "@context": {

                        "id": "@id",
                        "type": "@type",
                        "@type": "schema:string"
                    }
                },
                "pcf": {
                    "@id": "aspect:pcf",
                    "@context": {
                        "@version": 1.1,
                        "id": "@id",
                        "type": "@type",
                        "pcfExcludingBiogenic": {
                            "@id": "aspect:pcfExcludingBiogenic",
                            "@type": "schema:number",
                            "@context": {
                                "@definition": "PCF excluding biogenic emissions"
                            }
                        },
                        "fossilGhgEmissions": {
                            "@id": "aspect:fossilGhgEmissions",
                            "@type": "schema:number",
                            "@context": {
                                "@definition": "Fossil GHG emissions"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration with Verifiable Credentials

### Context Integration Process

Once the JSON-LD context is generated, it can be integrated into verifiable credentials:

1. **Context Generation**: Use `sammSchemaParser` to convert SAMM JSON Schema to JSON-LD context
2. **Context Hosting**: Host the generated context at a stable URL (Eclipse Tractus-X models must be stored in the [eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models) repository and be available in raw format for the public internet)
3. **Credential Creation**: Reference the hosted context in verifiable credentials for it to be verified.
4. **Semantic Validation**: Expand the verifiable credential JSON-LD document, to reveal inconsistencies with the semantics.

### Example Verifiable Credential with Generated Context

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
        "https://w3c.github.io/vc-jws-2020/contexts/v1/",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/main/io.catenax.pcf/7.0.0/gen/Pcf-context.jsonld"
    ],
    "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "DataAttestationCredential",
        "Pcf"
    ],
    "credentialSubject": {
        "@type": "urn:samm:io.catenax.pcf:7.0.0#Pcf",
        "specVersion": "urn:io.catenax.pcf:datamodel:version:7.0.0",
        "companyIds": ["https://example.com/company1"],

            "pcfExcludingBiogenic": 2.5,
            "fossilGhgEmissions": 1.8
        }
    },

```

## Semantic Validation Process

### Validation Workflow

The semantic validation process follows these steps:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Workflow as Workflow
    participant Parser as sammSchemaParser
    participant SemanticHub
    participant VC as Verifiable Credential
    participant IssuanceService as Issance Service
    
    alt Translation Flow
    Workflow->>SemanticHub: Get JSON Schema
    SemanticHub->>Workflow: JSON Schema
    Workflow->>Parser: Input Schema
    Parser->>Parser: Generate JSON-LD Context
    Parser->>Workflow: Provide @context file
    Workflow->>SemanticHub: Store in gen folder
    end
    
    alt Issuance Flow
    IssuanceService->>VC: Introduce @context in VC
    VC->>SemanticHub: Retrieve @context via HTTPS

    "@definition": "The Digital Product Passport (DPP) allows to share process and product-related information amongst supply chain businesses, authorities and consumers. The DPP allows for efficient information flows following best practices; and the possibility of accompanying the measures under this Regulation with mitigating measures so that impacts are expected to remain proportionate for SMEs.This is expected to increase transparency, both for supply chain businesses and for the general public, and increase efficiencies in terms of information transfer to support the data exchange between economic actors in integrating circularity in product design and manufacturing.\nIn particular, it is likely to help facilitate and streamline the monitoring and enforcement of the regulation carried out by EU and Member State authorities. It is also likely to provide a market-intelligence tool that may be used for revising and refining obligations in the future.\nThe DPP includes data about components, materials and chemical substances, information on reparability, spare parts, environmental impact and professional disposal for a product.\nThe data model will be updated, as newer versions of the regulation will be published.\nThe main basis is provided by the document \"Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC\" from March 30th, 2022. The latest version of the document was the provisional agreement between the EU Council and the Parliament from January 9th, 2024. The text is informal, but the content of the final regulation was agreed between these two institutions.\nThe Title of Ecodesign Regulation has been changed to: Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC.",

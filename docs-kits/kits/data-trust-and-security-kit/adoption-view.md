## Vision & Mission

### Vision
One core objective of data ecosystems is to enable secure data exchange between the participants within the ecosystem.
While the network can deliver trust in the participants, trust in the data is still required.
For that technical approaches are required. 
This KIT shall enable data transfer, where data consumer can trust in their consumed data through third parties within the network as well as defined verification and validation procedures. 

### Mission
This KIT aims to define solutions used in Catena-X to generate trust in the data consumed within the network.
This  includes definition of various terms such as verification and validation within the data ecosystem, data models used to describe data, initiatives already adressing trust as well as technical solutions to verify and validate data.

## Business Value & Benefits

### Why do we need trust?

### We do we need to do it digitally?
### Why verifiable credentials (W3C)?
### Where are existing trusted lists (synergies from other initiatives)
### Interoperability with multiple initiatives (UNTP, Battery Pass EU, Gaia-X, etc.)
### Specify that we use the Connector KIT (for private interface) and for public interface could be used another way (B2C topic)

## Use Case / Domain Explanation

### How the verification is done?
-> Roles and Responsibilities (similar to e.g., example use cases scenarios in traceability and circular economy)

### Revocation of credentials, how is that done?
-> see above

### Certified Data Credential & Certified Snapshot Credential (when are they used and for what)
-> elaborate in more detail on the use case scenarios behind the first DPP slide deck. Essentially, add the written story to the pictures in the slides.

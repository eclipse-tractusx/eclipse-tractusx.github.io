# Digital Product Passport Trust Kit

## Goal of the Data Trust Kit

The establishment of a validation and verification rulebook for Digital Product Passports (DPPs) is dedicated to ensuring the integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness of product information within the automotive industry. In a digitally interconnected environment, where numerous stakeholders collaboratively engage in the exchange of data, it becomes imperative to standardize the information conveyed through DPPs.

The primary goal of our rulebook is multifaceted: it safeguards the accuracy of data across all DPPs, fosters trust among industry participants, and lowers the barriers for adopting DPPs within the project. By providing clear, straightforward guidance and supporting documentation, the rulebook serves as an accessible resource that demystifies the process and facilitates the onboarding of diverse stakeholders into our collaborative initiatives.

## Why is Data Trust Necessary for Digital Product Passports?
Data trust is the cornerstone of effective collaboration within the automotive sector. It ensures that every piece of information exchanged is genuine, complete, and accurate, thus eliminating ambiguity and reducing the risk of misinformation. Trustworthy data empowers stakeholders—including manufacturers, suppliers, consumers, and regulators—to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and compliance across the supply chain. By adhering to our validation rulebook, companies can guarantee the trustworthiness of their DPPs, reinforcing confidence in the data that informs strategic and operational choices.

## Business Value of Validated Data
The business value of validated data is substantial and multifaceted. Reliable data enhances decision-making, reduces operational risks, and elevates the credibility of companies within the industry. Validated data through DPPs enables:

* Improved Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring that data is precise and verified minimizes the risk of regulatory infractions and associated penalties.
* Enhanced Product Transparency: Providing clear, truthful information about product composition and sourcing builds consumer trust and strengthens brand reputation.
* Operational Efficiency: Accurate data streamlines processes by reducing errors, improving inventory management, and facilitating seamless communication across the supply chain.
* Strategic Advantage: Companies that embrace validated data can better forecast trends, optimize resource allocation, and innovate in product development.



Ultimately, the validation rulebook is crucial not only for assuring data reliability but also for driving competitive advantage and inclusivity. It equips automotive companies, regardless of size, with the tools necessary to leverage data effectively, nurturing growth and sustainability in an increasingly digitalized market landscape.

## Research

Currently, within initiatives such as Catena-X, Together for Sustainability (TfS), Wikipedia, and the Partnership for Carbon Transparency (PACT), there exists a significant divergence in the interpretation of the terms "verification" and "validation."
The following sub section provides a brief overview of the differing definitions.

### TfS:
#### Verification: 
Process for evaluating an environmental information **statement based on historical data** and information to determine whether the statement conforms with the relevant criteria. 
#### Validation:
Process for evaluating the plausibility of assumptions, limitations and methods that support an environmental information **statement about the outcome of future activities**.
Two situations:
- Projection of PCFs for existing products into the future: Reflecting changes in material source, sourcing of purchased parts, technology, tooling, energy mix etc..
- Prediction of PCFs for new product developments not in serial production yet
The term “environmental information validation” is shortened to “validation” in this document to reduce sentence complexity and aid understanding.

In the context of Together for Sustainability (TfS), "verification" refers to the evaluation of historical Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs), while "validation" pertains to the assessment of projected or future PCFs. These definitions are derived from ISO 14065:2020 and ISO 14066:2023. However, as these interpretations are highly specific to PCFs—and even within the PCF domain, definitions of verification and validation vary across initiatives such as PACT (as outlined below), a thorough evaluation has led to the conclusion that they are currently not well-suited for addressing "data plausibility" within Digital Product Passports

### PACT
#### Verification: 
The process of independently assessing whether reported PCF **data is accurate, complete, and conforms to a defined methodology** or standard. 
Based on the definition provided above, a simplified interpretation would be: "Determining whether the data has been calculated in accordance with established guidelines and standards."

#### Validation:
The process of confirming that the **methodology, assumptions, and data used** to estimate future or modeled PCFs are appropriate and reasonable.
In simpler terms, this can be understood as evaluating whether the data appears logical and internally consistent in terms of its content.

This interpretation is consistent with the definitions found on Wikipedia and also closely reflects our own understanding of the terms "verification" and "validation."

### Wikipedia
Verification and validation are independent procedures that are used together for checking that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose. These are critical components of a quality management system such as ISO 9001:2015 (Quality management systems requirements) 
#### Verification: 
Verification activities are conducted to ensure that the design and development **outputs meet the input requirements** (i.e., does it follow the standards).
#### Validation:
Validation activities are conducted to ensure that the resulting products and services meet the requirements for the specified application or intended use (i.e., is it fit for purpose).

After thorough reserach of these standards and guidelines, the Data Trust team drew two conclusions:
- Verification refers to the process of assessing whether the submitted **data has been calculated in accordance with relevant guidelines and standards**. Validation, on the other hand, involves conducting plausibility checks to determine **whether the data is reasonable**, coherent, and suitable for exchange within supply chains
- Given the varying definitions of "verification" and "validation" across different platforms and use cases, achieving consensus on a single, universally applicable definition—particularly between contexts such as Digital Product Passports (DPPs) and Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs)—has proven challenging. This is especially true considering the differing levels of maturity between these use cases.

As a result, we have chosen not to invest extensive time in harmonizing definitions. To avoid potential confusion associated with the terms "verification" and "validation," we have introduced a new concept: the "Trust Kit." The purpose of the Trust Kit initiative is to establish a set of rules and criteria that enable both data providers and data consumers to assess the plausibility of data exchanged through Digital Product Passports. Further deatils are descried in following section.

# Characteristics

The "Characteristics" category refers to a set of descriptive attributes that define the physical, functional, and environmental properties of a product. These characteristics are essential for assessing a product’s sustainability performance and are typically included in the Digital Product Passport (DPP).
 
Key elements under this category may include:
<br>1- Physical attributes: Size, weight, dimensions, color, and material composition.
<br>2- Functional properties: Intended use, performance capabilities, and compatibility.
<br>3- Environmental characteristics: Energy consumption, emissions, recyclability, and presence of hazardous substances.
<br>4- Lifecycle information: Expected lifespan, maintenance needs, and end-of-life options.
 
These characteristics enable standardized documentation, comparability across products, and informed decision-making by stakeholders such as consumers, manufacturers, and regulators.

## Quality Data Offers at EDC

When a Data Consumer calls the Catalog of a Data Provider, the Data Provider must signal in each Data Offer what exactly a Consumer could negotiate for. Data Offers in the Catalog are sorted by dcat:Datasets which are registered in the EDC- Management API as edc:Asset. Each Asset has private and public properties. The public properties are shown in the catalog and give hints to the Data Consumer what API and data they may expect. There are some properties that are mandatory for the entire Catena-X network and some that are mandatory only in specific Business Scenarios (like Quality).

The dataAddress object's structure is determined by the dataplane implementation as it configures the details of the data transfer. They are not visible via the catalog.

The following suggestion is a non-standardized draft how Assets (and thus by proxy, dcat:Datasets) should be registered in the Quality Use-Case.

### S3 Data Address

This section is not use-case specific but since the EDC's AmazonS3 dataplane is basically undocumented, here is an explanation:

| **Property**        | **Value**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| edc:type            | "AmazonS3"                 | This shows which data source the Data Plane will query. It also determines what other content the dataAddress object must hold.                                                                                                    |
| edc:region          | "eu-west-1"                | This property represents the AWS-region where the source bucket is located.                                                                                                                                                        |
| edc:bucketName      | "provider-quality-bucket"  | This is the name of the source bucket that the data to-be-transferred resides in.                                                                                                                                                  |
| edc:keyName         | "path/through/provider/s3" | This is the path of the file that shall be offered to the dataspace.                                                                                                                                                               |
| edc:accessKeyId     | "\<keyId\>"                | Amazon S3 uses this property similarly to how oauth2 client credentials use the clientId. Note that this can also be set during deployment-time for the whole S3-dataplane. If it's set here, it will override the default config. |
| edc:secretAccessKey | "\<secretAccessKey\>"      | This secret is used similarly to a clientSecret in oauth2 client credentials.                                                                                                                                                      |

As currently only parquet files are used, the type application/octet-stream with the added property type=parquet-snappy must be used.

The version in here refers to the data model's version, while the EDC-property cx-common:version defines the version of the underlying API serving the data.                                                                                                                        |

All Asset types defined in this Kit must include this property as it links the data behind an asset with the correct QualityTask. Note that the id of the QualityTask must be used, not the id of the EDC-Asset shielding said QualityTask.                                                                                                                                                     |

The expectation that this would be signaled via the dcat:DataSet-dcat:distribution property of the catalog currently isn't implemented in the EDC.

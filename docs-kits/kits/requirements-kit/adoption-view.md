## Vision & Mission

### Vision

Our vision is to establish a seamless, secure, and efficient engineering platform within the Catena-X ecosystem. In a first step a collaborative platform for cross company requirements management that enables quick information access and multiple company collaboration via a standardized solution in the Catena-X dataspace, inspired by ReqIF (Requirements Interchange Format). By leveraging ReqIF, we aim to optimize the information flow and collaboration between OEMs and their suppliers, fostering a deep understanding and clear communication of requirements across company boundaries, while reducing time for exchanging requirements from point to point using common data exchange tools.

At the heart of this commitment is the guarantee of data sovereignty any time. Each partner should be able to share their data securely while retaining full control over their own information. This enables transparent and trustworthy collaboration in product development by providing all stakeholders access to relevant requirement sets and documents without compromising proprietary or confidential information.

This vision opens the way for innovative and collaborative product development by providing a structured and standardized method for managing, exchanging, and validating requirements across supply chains. This new approach promises significant advantages such as:

1.	Enhanced Connectivity and Collaboration: We envision a digital landscape where all stakeholders can quickly access and share requirements data, fostering innovation and reducing time-to-market for new products.
2.	Standardization and Interoperability: Efficiently manage the diversity of requirements and specifications, ensuring that different systems can seamlessly communicate with each other.
3.	Data Sovereignty and Security: By employing the secure infrastructure of Catena-X, partners can maintain full control over their data while ensuring it is protected during exchanges, thereby building trust and transparency across the network.
4.	Real-time Integration and Agility: Through Catena-X, changes and updates to requirements can be synchronized in realtime, allowing teams to respond swiftly to evolving project needs and external challenges.
5.	Improved Quality and Compliance: This unified platform will not only enhance the accuracy and consistency of requirements data but also streamline compliance with industry standards and regulations, ultimately elevating product quality.



### Mission
The Requirements Kit aims to meticulously outline requirements by incorporating essential standards, aspect models and business logics. Its approach is designed to facilitate the exchange of requirements information between OEMs and Tier-N suppliers, ensuring that all relevant data is gathered and enabling authorized stakeholders to collaborate effectively. The data exchange process adheres to the Catena-X network's principles of data sovereignty, ensuring secure and compliant interactions. By following a standardized pipeline and utilizing data models within a data ecosystem, each partner is empowered to use their preferred applications, fostering a flexible and efficient collaboration environment.


## Business Value & Benefits

### Business Value
The "Requirements-KIT" provides guidelines and standards, such as semantic models and data exchange processes, which help companies create a reliable and sovereign data exchange system with their partners. 

This reduces cost and effort needed to integrate data-driven engineering processes into their operations and IT systems. 

Since this KIT is built on the Industry Core KIT and will be closely connected to upcoming other KITSs within the Engineering Domain, investment and implementation costs to integrate requirement services are reduced.

### Todays Challenge

As product development becomes more and more cross-company, the requirements that are necessary for the specification of the product to be developed must also be exchanged and harmonized across companies. This exchange for coordination between the customer and the development partner takes place in an iterative process that results in various documentation and changes to the specifications.

Nowadays, the exchange of requirements is largely file-based, with the files being provided or exchanged via company portals (B2B platforms), for example. In most cases, the requirements are first managed by the client in special requirements management software. As a starting point for collaboration in the product development process, one or more files for the product to be developed are extracted from the requirements management software with the requirements and possibly other information and made available to the development partner. In order for the development partner to view and evaluate the requirements, they must import the file into their requirements management tool (which may or may not be the same as the customer's). Once the requirements have been evaluated by the development partner, the partner exports another file from its requirements management tool and makes it available to the client. The client then imports this file back into its system and evaluates the development partner's scores, comments, etc.

This involves the circular processing of requests between partners, which can result in multiple file exports and imports to and from the respective systems. Each import/export results in a break in the data. Changes within each version of the files must be tracked and displayed by the requirements management tools. This method of working with requirements is very time consuming and requires a lot of manual effort that has nothing to do with the actual evaluation of the requirements.

In addition to the challenges mentioned above, there is also the issue that the files can be designed in a variety of content forms and the formats of the files can also vary. The formats can be divided into structured and unstructured files. Unstructured files are texts, tables etc. that are not organized into individual requirements without prior processing. These increase the effort required to organize the document into individual requirements. This also makes the exchange with the partner more difficult, as the partner does not know the newly created structure. With structured files, the aforementioned circumstances no longer exist, as the requirements are already organized. In the best case, a standardized form, such as the ReqIF format, is used. However, even when using standardized formats such as ReqIF, it is still necessary to agree on a common data model for exporting and importing in advance so that data exchange via the various requirements management tools works as smoothly as possible.

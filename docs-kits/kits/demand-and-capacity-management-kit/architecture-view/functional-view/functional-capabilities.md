| 1  | Define Demands                            | Editing demand values using the `List Part` of the `View single Material Demand` view.                             | Write `WeekBasedMaterialDemand`                             | Read `Material Base Data` | Demands could be calculated from `planned production` data in combination with `bill of material` data.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Inspect weeks that are marked as `bottleneck` | Read `WeekBasedMaterialDemand` and `WeekBasedCapacityGroup` | N/A                       | Aside from color coding weeks, as defined by [CX-0128](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0128-DemandandCapacityManagementDataExchange#571-matching-results-and-resolution), company specific business logic could be applied to aid in bottleneck detection, prevention and categorization. |

Creating comments in a sensible way could aid the users greatly.                                                                                                                                         |

## Role Supplier

Automating the data entry and data sharing aspects of this role is partially achievable and much harder, compared to the customer.
In order to automate linking material demands to capacity group fully knowledge about ones own bill of material as well as partial knowledge of the bill of material of ones business partner is required.
Automating define capacities, Define Load Factors, Define Delta Production and Define Volatility Metrics requires an already well automated production planning.

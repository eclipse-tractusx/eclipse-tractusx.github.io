(Have reached a business maturity level and validate against the corresponding json schema)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3  | Compare Demands and Capacities            | View `Graph` `List` and `Timeline` of `View single Material Demand`. Inspect weeks that are marked as `bottleneck`                       | Read `WeekBasedMaterialDemand` and `WeekBasedCapacityGroup` | N/A                                                          | Aside from color coding weeks, as defined by [CX-0128](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/CX-0128-DemandandCapacityManagementDataExchange#571-matching-results-and-resolution), company specific business logic could be applied to aid in bottleneck detection, prevention and categorization. |
| 4  | Use comments                              | Aside from an inbox approach one could also mark all objects and weeks that have comments attached to them.                              | Write, Read and Share `IdBasedComments`                     | Read `Business Partner Base Data`                            | Because comments can related to specific capacity groups, demand, weeks or even other comments. Creating comments in a sensible way could aid the users greatly.                                                                                                                                         |
| 5  | Use supply chain disruption notifications |                                                                                                                                          | Write, Read and Share `DemandAndCapacityNotification`       | Read `Business Partner Base Data`                            | Because reacting to a Disruption Notification properly requires knowledge about bill of materials, storage levels, logistic chains etc. there potential for speeding up the process by providing these information to the user in a unified interface and then later on in automating the whole process.  |
| 6  | Collaborate                               | Having contact information not only within the `Business Partner Base Data` but directly shown within the capacity group can be helpful. | N/A                                                         | Read `Business Partner Base Data`                            | Low. And even if it sounds like a good idea, as of August 2025 a large language model can not do this. Therefore currently no potential for automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Role Supplier

Automating the data entry and data sharing aspects of this role is partially achievable and much harder, compared to the customer.
To fully automate linking of material demands to capacity groups, comprehensive knowledge of one's own bill of material, as well as partial insight into the bill of material of business partners, is required.
Automating define capacities, define load factors, define delta production and define volatility metrics requires an already well automated production planning.

## Bill of Material (BoM)

A bill of material resembles the structure of an end product. It is a list of all raw materials, sub-assemblies and sub-components that are needed to manufacture the end procuct.
At Catena-X Traceability we consider more than one single BoM. The BoM changes during the lifecyle and therefore, we are talking about different BoMs in different lifecycles.

### BoM Representations

#### Single-Level BOM

A single-level BOM represents one level of an assembly and does not include any lower-level subassemblies.

#### Multi-Level BOM

A Multi-Level Bill of Materials (BOM) is a [bill of materials (BOM)](https://www.bterrell.com/sage-accpac-erp/manufacturing/definition-multi-level-bom/definition-bom/) that lists the components, assemblies, and materials required to make a part. It provides a display of all components that are directly or indirectly used in a parent item. When an item is a subcomponent, blend, intermediate, etc., all of its components, including purchased parts and [raw materials](https://www.bterrell.com/sage-accpac-erp/manufacturing/definition-multi-level-bom/definition-bom/definition-raw-materials/), are also exhibited. A multilevel structure can be illustrated by a tree with several levels. A multi-level BOM is created by connecting a series of individual single level BOMs together.

#### Flattened BOM

Flattening BOM means the intermediate levels in the BOM are removed and the lowest level is directly connected to the highest level.

### BoM Lifecycle Stages

BoM LifeCycleStage concept based on STEP AP242 with slight adoptions in layout & wording:

- Each instance can be identified by unique (within the organization) serial number (SN).
- The ‘multi-SN’ (multi Serial number) describes product defined with a generic part or item
- The ‘one per SN’ (one per Serial number) describes product defined with an individual part or item

| **AsDesigned (AsDeveloped)** | multi-SN | Currently Not Implemented |Part number* <br />may not be the specific part number but a code that describes a part<br />(technische Produktbeschreibung)  |BoM asDesigned is generated in the design phase of a new product including alternative parts. |Build up the initial BoM in design phase of a new automotive product including alternative parts<br />Expected to have research & development part descriptions instead of specific part numbers |starting 2 years before SoP (for e.g. of a new vehicle project) |150% incl. variants which will not be used later |partly known<br />can be open at this point of time |
| **AsPlanned** | multi-SN | **Implemented** |Part number|BoM AsPlanned is used to plan the manufacturing process including alternative parts. |BoM AsPlanned is used to plan manufacturing including alternative parts.<br />Sourcing will most likely be based on this (besides key parts which start earlier) |starting 1,5 years before building the first component |120% of all variants are covered, incl. possibly multiple suppliers for the same component |fixed suppliers, could be more than one supplier per part|
| **AsOrdered** | one per SN | Currently Not Implemented |Part number | BoM AsOrdered is used for manufacturing realization. | BoM that is used for manufacturing realization.<br /> This is the list of parts & components currently used for manufactoring after start of production (SOP) or shortly before.| fixed order<br />(production order or custom order)|100% exact order is known |fixed suppliers, could be more than one supplier per part|
| **AsBuilt** | one per SN | **Implemented**|Serial number / batch number | BoM AsBuilt describes a product as manufactured. | BoM as a component is built or manufactured.<br />During manufactoring of for e.g. a vehicle the serial numbers & batch numbers are documented (German: Verbaudokumentation).<br />This leads to one BoM per built car|during building process or directly after finishing|100% |one specific supplier|
| **AsSupported / AsFlying / AsMaintained / AsOperated** | one per SN | Currently Not Implemented |Serial number / batch number | BoM AsMaintained describes the product after purchasing by a customer and updates by maintenance. | BoM after for e.g. a vehicle was picked up by the customer. Changes to live cycle before may apply due to maintenance or repair work e.g. exchange of parts, liquids, ...|Starts when customer has picked up the product, updating if any change is done|100% inkl. replaced parts, incl. history of exchanged parts |one specific supplier|
| **AsRecycled** | - |Currently Not Implemented| Serial number / batch number | BoM AsRecycled describes the BoM after the recycling of the product. | Requirement for Batteries.||100% ||

Two of the considered BoMs are already implemented in the use case Traceability and will be described as follows.

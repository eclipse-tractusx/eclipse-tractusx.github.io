The Connector Kit is providing insides into the standardized way of interaction between two dataspace participants concerning the usage of the Dataspace Protocol. The specified aspects from the standard are in principle complete to participate in the dataspace with an implementation. Nonetheless, the reference implementation provided in Eclipse Tractus-X, the [Tractus-X EDC][edc-url] is a full implementation of the standard which is production-ready and in heavy use throughout the Catena-X dataspace. DUe to this importance, this section of the adoption view is intended to give insights into the reference implementation in order to understand, how the reference implementation provides access to the Dataspace Protocol interaction between a Data Consumer and a Data Provider. The reference implementation, thereby, defines a de-facto standards for aspects for the interaction inside of a Dataspace Participant between his application stack and the connector.

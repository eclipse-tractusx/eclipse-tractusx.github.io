## VISION & MiSSION

### VISION

Calculating Remaining Useful Life is a business.

The *Behaviour Twin KIT*  aims at novel business models based on the calculation of Remaining Useful Life. The wide range of possible applications starts with product development and finally extends to recycling: the entire product life cycle offers potential. 

The *Behaviour Twin KIT* provides efficient support in planning, designing, building, using and operating Remaining Useful Life Services and applications based on them.

### MISSION

This use-case-specific part of the *Behavior Twin KIT* aims further to facilitate the development of scalable and interoperable
solutions for calculation of the *remaining useful life* of products by connecting the data providers, typically OEMs, and service providers, typically supplier
within the supply chain in a generic way. It guides business and software developers
by explaining key concepts and by directing them to relevant technical resources and code examples.

## STATUS QUO & CHALLENGES

see [*Status quo & challenges in general part of the KIT*](../../../adoption-view/introduction.md#status-quo--challenge)

## USE CASES

**OEM, TIER-X**: In the early development phase, components can be designed using digital prototypes based on component-specific damage calculation. The load data required for this comes from simulation or measurement in the digital twin.

**Tier-X**: The overall product range becomes more attractive in the offer phase when model-based damage calculation is included as a product-related service.

**OEMs, car dealers and automotive clubs**: During usage phase they can further interpret the Remaining Useful Life calculation for a vehicle evaluation and offer it as vehicle-related services for their end customers and fleet operators.

**Automotive clubs, car dealers, insurers, fleet operators and recyclers**: Even during the usage phase, but particularly during the recycling phase, they all benefit from precise residual value analyses of the entire vehicle and its components on the basis of component-specific damage calculation.

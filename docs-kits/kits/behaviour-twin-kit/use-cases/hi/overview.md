## PURPOSE

The business logic of the Health Indicator use case is to provide and get the health condition of technical systems.

This template shows a use case where an consumer who is also data provider defines a skill, where the schema of the calculation services' input parameter is unknown to the skill provider (due to heterogeneous calculation services). The consumer knows the actual calculation service provider(s) and can access its graph assets.

## DISCLAIMER

![caution](../../assets/caution.drawio.svg) This is only a template use case. It is not to be used as is, but provides a great starting building block for further implementation of a concrete use case.

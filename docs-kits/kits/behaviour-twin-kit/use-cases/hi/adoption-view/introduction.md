## VISION & MiSSION

### VISION

Health monitoring of products and components is highly attractive. It offers significant added value for OEMs and suppliers and is already often part of the product range or product inquiry.

The *Behaviour Twin KIT* efficiently supports the planning, design, construction, use and operation of product-related services for health monitoring as part of quality management.

Based on the calculation of health indicators, the performance and condition of products and components in the field can be continuously monitored, recorded and transmitted along the supply chain. During the usage phase, abnormalities, possible defects or failures are reliably and identified early on, so that measures can be taken in good time.

### MISSION

This use-case-specific part of the *Behavior Twin KIT* aims further to facilitate the development of scalable and interoperable
solutions for *health monitoring* of products by connecting the data providers, typically OEMs, and service providers, typically supplier
within the supply chain in a generic way. It guides business and software developers
by explaining key concepts and by directing them to relevant technical resources and code examples.

## STATUS QUO & CHALLENGES

see [*Status quo & challenges in general part of the KIT*](../../../adoption-view/introduction.md#status-quo--challenge)

## USE CASES

**OEM, TIER-X**: During the usage phase, health indicators provide a continuous and comprehensive view of the condition of products in the field. Abnormalities, possible defects or failures can be detected reliably and early on. This provides the time advantage to initiate countermeasures in good time. During development phase, health indicators can be used to bring more mature products into series production.

**Tier-X**: The overall product range becomes more attractive in the offer phase, when the definition of health indicators as a product-related service is included.

**Workshops**: In case of failure analysis and repair, workshops benefit from an extended range of data on vehicle condition and its components. In return, service providers can standardize and facilitate access to the OEM.

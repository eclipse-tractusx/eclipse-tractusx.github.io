*This section contains dedicated use cases within the overarching Behaviour Twin use case. These can be considered as examples, further references, and templates for the development of new use cases.*

*The former KITs for those use cases (**Remaining useful Life KIT** and **Health Indicator KIT**) are hereby deprecated.*

## CONTENTS

The following (template) use cases are part of this KIT:

- [Remaining useful Life](rul/overview)
- [Health Indicator](hi/overview)

Another Behaviour Twin use case (not part of this KIT) is the exchange and collaborative use of simulation and data processing models, see:

- [Model Based Development and Data Processing KIT](../../Behaviour%20Twin%20MDP%20Kit/page_adoption-view)

*Federated simulation* is not yet part of any Behaviour Twin KIT, but could be an interesting approach in the future.

*This section provides a quick overview over the KIT's scope, its direction and how you can benefit from using it for your own applications and use cases.*

## VISION & MISSION

### VISION

Aggregating real-world usage data of technical products is state-of-the-art. But only by combining this data with digital twins, simulation models and specialized calculation services, new business opportunities and operational efficiencies become possible across the entire product lifecycle. The key to successfully enabling these opportunities is the efficient scalability of digital solutions, their extension across business boundaries and handling data protection and governance.

### MISSION

The Behaviour Twin KIT aims to facilitate the development of scalable and interoperable solutions for connecting service customers, data providers and service providers across organizational boundaries in a generic way. The KIT allows a Behaviour-Twin-oriented entry to state-of-the-art Knowledge Agent technology. It guides business and software developers by explaining key concepts and by directing them to relevant technical resources and examples.

## STATUS QUO & CHALLENGE

### STATUS QUO

Within company boundaries, the aggregation of usage data, monitoring them, e.g. by calculation of health indicators or component damage based on internally available data and models, is already state-of-the-art. However, across these boundaries, there are only individual, complex and not generally available solutions. Often, additional use cases or  participants require repetitive efforts to implement instances for connecting data and calculation services.

### TODAY'S CHALLENGE

Thus, the following challenges must be addressed:

- correctly allocating component data and calculation service across organizational boundaries
- ensuring data compliance across complex supply chains
- enabling secure data sharing while respecting IP and governance
- fulfill high data sovereignty standards
- facilitating flexible customization for diverse use cases
- reduce effort for additional use cases and participants

## USE CASE EXAMPLES

Typical scenarios comprise stakeholders acting during a certain phase in the product lifecycle:

- **OEM, TIER-X @ Early product development phase:** Components can be optimally designed using digital prototypes and simulations based on usage data and models.

- **OEM, TIER-X @ Offer phase:** Suppliers can enhance their products with value-added services like health monitoring and Remaining useful Life calculation making them more attractive for their customers.

- **OEM, TIER-X @ Usage phase:** Precise monitoring of product health and residuals value helps enable predictive maintenance, optimized operations and end-of-life decision making.

- **Car dealers and automotive clubs @ usage phase:** Further interpreting the Remaining useful Life calculation for a vehicle evaluation and offer it as vehicle-related services for their end customers and fleet operators.

- **Car dealers and automotive clubs @ Recycling phase:** An accurate residual value analysis allows optimal dismantling, reuse and recycling.

## BENEFITS

In summary, building a use case upon the Behavior Twin KIT accelerates development, ensures compliance, facilitates collaboration, unlocks business value, and creates business benefits across the product lifecycle.

Benefits in more detail:

- Offers guidance to build solutions on Knowledge Agent technology. This enables efficient scalability for additional use cases and participants. For further details how scalability is gained, and complexity is reduced, see the section [Knowledge Agent](./knowledge-agent#benefits).

- Enables scalable and interoperable solutions for connecting different stakeholders like service customers, data providers, and service providers across organizational boundaries. This allows for collaboration and data sharing.

- Enables stakeholders to optimize components, enhance products with value-added services, enable predictive maintenance, and make better end-of-life decisions. This leads to cost savings and sustainability.

- Facilitates the development of solutions for aggregating real-world usage data of technical products and combining it with digital twins, simulation models, and specialized calculation services. This unlocks new business opportunities and operational efficiencies.

- Supports handling data protection, governance, IP rights, and high data sovereignty standards when enabling secure data sharing across complex supply chains. This ensures compliance and builds trust.

- Guides business and software developers by explaining key concepts and directing them to relevant technical resources and examples. This speeds up understanding and development.

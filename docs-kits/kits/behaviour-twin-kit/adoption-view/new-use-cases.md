If you start to build up an very new use case within the overarching Behaviour Twin use case, you may first read the [Adoption View](./overview) of this KIT. It provides additional information for quick understanding of the used technologies. In particular, see also the [To Be Considered](./to-be-considered) section.

To build up the use case, follow the following steps:

- join Catena-X (see [participate section on catena-x.net ![(external link)](../assets/external-link.svg)](https://catena-x.net/en/participate))
- develop a business process
- define participants and their roles
- consider data protection requirements
- identify the use case type (who initiates requests, who is data provider, where are skills located)
- design data model/ontology (maybe, existing ontologies are already sufficient or can be extended)
- design a use case framework agreement (or use the *Behaviour Twin Use Case Agreement* if appropriate)
- define logic (implement skill(s))
- deploy dataspace components (EDC and Knowledge Agent components)
- provide (bind) data
- provide (bind) calculation services
- test the skill(s) with partners

The [Use Case Templates](../use-cases/overview) within this KIT can be used as starting point for the technical development.

For further guidance, refer also to [Guidance And Resources](../development-view/guidance-and-resources) in the Development View.

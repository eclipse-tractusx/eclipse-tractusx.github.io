## Connector Data Asset Structure

To enable notifications, the recipient has to register its notification API as a data asset as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "cx-taxo": "https://w3id.org/catenax/taxonomy#",
    "cx-common": "https://w3id.org/catenax/ontology/common#",
    "dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
  },
  "@id": "{{DEMAND_AND_CAPACITY_NOTIFICATIONS_REQUEST_API_ASSET_ID}}",
  "properties": {
    "dct:type": {
      "@id": "cx-taxo:DemandAndCapacityNotificationApi"
    },
    "cx-common:version": "2.0",
    "description": "Demand and Capacity Notification API Endpoint"
  },
  "dataAddress": {
    "@type": "DataAddress",
    "type": "HttpData",
    "proxyBody": "true",
    "proxyMethod": "true",
    "baseUrl": "{{DEMAND_AND_CAPACITY_NOTIFICATION_API_ENDPOINT}}",
    "contentType": "application/json"
  }
}
```

This asset can then be contracted by senders of notifications.

## Versioning

The Catena-X versioning applies. For version `2.0.0` of the Demand and Capacity API, a new asset and backend notification receiver MUST be created as shown in Figure 4 below.

![figure 1 - API versioning of the Demand and Capacity Notification API](../resources/notifications_connector_versioning.drawio.svg)

Figure 1: *Versioning of the Demand and Capacity Notification based on CX-0151*

## Sample Data

The semantic models in the business context are defined in the Adoption View of this KIT. This chapter gives additional information for each aspect model by providing the example data objects in JSON format, link to the RDF turtle file on GitHub and unique semantic id of the aspect model. Currently the standard *Supply Chain Disruption Notifications* provides one semantic model *Demand and Capacity Notification*.

The Demand and Capacity Notification consists of a header and a content, that are assembled in the following format:

```json
{
    "header": <messageHeader>,
    "content": {
        <DemandAndCapacityNotification>
    }
}
```

The definition following aspect models are used for their respective properties following table 1.

| Property | Aspect Model with Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

[StandardLibrary]: https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/next/standards/CX-0146-SupplyChainDisruptionNotifications

## Rules for Sending Notifications

Demand and Capacity Notifications allow to be sent, updated, resolved and forwarded to partners who are influences (see adoption view). In the following we'll cover how to process the different scenarios.

### Create the Initial Notification

Figure 1 illustrates the key activities when creating the initial notification as the originator of a disruption.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
Participant p1 as Participant 1
Participant p2 as Participant 2

note right of p1: significant demand or capacity change<br>(issue) detected
p1 ->> p1: assess issue
p1 ->> p1: identify affected partners,<br>parts, sites, time horizon
p1 ->> p1: generate sourceDisruptionId
loop Create and send notification per partner
  p1 ->> p1: generate notificationId
  p1 ->> p1: prepare and contextualize<br>notification
  p1 ->> p2: send notification
  p2 ->> p2: validate and save notification
  p2 ->> p2: evaluate and handle notification
end
```

Figure 2: *Create initial notification.*

Common triggers for creating the initial disruptions are occurrences affecting the demand or capacity within a customer-supplier relationship as stated by the `rootCause` in the [semantic model](../adoption-view.md#semantic-models) e.g., natural disasters.

:::note
Partners should align on cases in which they want to use these notifications. E.g., they may align to only send notifications in case they can't cope with the issue, or always in case a disruption occurs even if it's handled.
:::

:::info
Refer to the [standard](../adoption-view.md#normative-references) and the [semantic model](../adoption-view.md#semantic-models) of supply chain disruption notifications for more explicit information on how to set the fields.
:::

### Update and Resolve a Notification

Figure 3 illustrates the key activities when updating a notification. Resolving the notification is a specific version of updating a notification and explained in [a following section](#resolve-a-notification).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
Participant p1 as Participant 1
Participant p2 as Participant 2

note right of p1: ...notification has already been sent...
note right of p1: ...need for update arose (e.g. additional part affected)...
p1 ->> p1: identify previous notification(s)
loop Create and send update per notification per partner
  p1 ->> p1: update affected partners,<br>parts, sites, time horizon, text
  p1 ->> p2: send updated notification
  p2 ->> p2: identify previous version of notification
  note right of p2: Notifications are identified by notification.id<br>and the sender of the message
  p2 ->> p2: validate and save update
  p2 ->> p2: evaluate and handle notification
end
```

Figure 3: *Update previously sent notification.*

:::tip
When identifying the notification, one should assure that the sender and the notificationId belong together. Besides relying only on the header.senderBpn, one may additionally use the bpn received from the connector's data plane.
:::

Following fields are immutable and copied from the previous notification:

- `sourceDisruptionId`
- `notificationId`
- `effect`
- `leadingRootCause`

Following fields may or must be updated in case of an update without resolving:

- `materialsAffected` may be added or removed
- `affectedSitesSender` may be added or removed
- `affectedSitesRecipient` may be added or removed
- `startDateOfEffect`
- `expectedEndDateOfEffect`
- `contentChangedAt`
- `relatedNotificationIds` may be added
- `text`

:::info
Refer to the [standard](../adoption-view.md#normative-references) and the [semantic model](../adoption-view.md#semantic-models) of supply chain disruption notifications for more explicit information on how to set the fields.
:::

#### Resolve a Notification

Resolving a notification is a special case of an update. To resolve a notification, consider the following rules:

Update the following fields:

- `resolvingMeasureDescription`
- `status` should be set to `resolved`
- `materialsAffected` should be empty
- `affectedSitesSender` should be empty
- `affectedSitesRecipient` should be empty

:::info
Refer to the [standard](../adoption-view.md#normative-references) and the [semantic model](../adoption-view.md#semantic-models) of supply chain disruption notifications for more explicit information on how to set the fields.
:::

### Forward a Notification

Figure 4 illustrates the key activities when forwarding a disruption represented by a notification.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
Participant p1 as Participant 1
Participant p2 as Participant 2
Participant p3 as Participant 3

p1 ->> p2: send notification n1
note right of p1: Participant 2 received a notification.

p2 ->> p2: validate and save notification n1
p2 ->> p2: analyze notification n1 and situation
note right of p2: Participant 2 discovers that he is affected

p2 ->> p2: identify relatedNotifications and<br>remember their notificationIds as<br>receivedRelatedNotificationIds
note right of p2: Note: related notifications are those with <br>sourceDisruptionId = n1.sourceDisruptionId.

p2 ->> p2: identify affected partners,<br>parts, sites, time horizon
loop Create and send notification per affected partner
  p2 ->> p2: generate notificationId
  p2 ->> p2: copy sourceDisruptionId, effect,<br>leadingRootCause
  p2 ->> p2: add receivedRelatedNotificationIds to <br>newNotification.relatedNotificationIds

  p2 ->> p2: prepare and contextualize<br>notification
  p2 ->> p3: send notification
  p3 ->> p3: validate and save notification
  p3 ->> p3: evaluate and handle notification
end
```

Figure 4: *Forward disruption represented by a notification.*

Following fields are immutable and indirectly copied from the source disruption:

- `sourceDisruptionId`
- `effect`
- `leadingRootCause`

Following fields may or must be set and contextualized:

- `notificationId`
- `materialsAffected`
- `affectedSitesSender`
- `affectedSitesRecipient`
- `startDateOfEffect`
- `expectedEndDateOfEffect`
- `contentChangedAt`
- `relatedNotificationIds` may be added
- `text`

:::info
Refer to the [standard](../adoption-view.md#normative-references) and the [semantic model](../adoption-view.md#semantic-models) of supply chain disruption notifications for more explicit information on how to set the fields.

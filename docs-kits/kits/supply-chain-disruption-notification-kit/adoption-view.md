Through these principles, the Supply Chain Disruption Notifications is not only addressing the immediate needs for better disruption management but also laying the groundwork for a more resilient, adaptive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystems.

### Example Use Case

#### Streamlining Disruption Management in Automotive Manufacturing

The automotive industry, particularly in the context of increasing complexity and interconnectivity in supply chains, faces significant challenges in managing disruptions.

Consider a scenario where an unexpected disruption occurs in the supply of aluminum, a critical material for vehicle manufacturing. This disruption could arise from various factors such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or logistical challenges, impacting multiple manufacturers and their production lines. The aluminum producer (sender) must evaluate the impact and identify which products and stakeholders are affected. If the impact is significant, the sender will communicate the current situation upstream in a notification, potentially informing its supplier as well. Another scenario would be that an OEM notifies their suppliers about a significant demand increase which then potentially goes down the supply chain.

For both scenarios, the recipient of this notification reviews the content and assesses the impact on their operations. Based on this assessment, the recipient determines whether further stakeholders need to be informed (either one level up or down the supply chain). If additional notifications are necessary, the recipient, now acting as the sender, drafts a new message (including a UID for the original message) to inform subsequent recipients. These recipients then evaluate the impact on their own operations and decide if further notifications are required.

In this context, the "Supply Chain Disruption Notifications" plays a significant role in addressing these challenges by facilitating swift and standardized communication of supply chain disruptions.

#### Implementation Example

1. **Disruption Notification Initiation:** When a primary supplier of aluminum faces a disruption, it utilizes the "Supply Chain Disruption Notification" to send out an alert. This notification includes detailed information about the nature of the disruption, expected impact, and the estimated duration of the disruption.
1. **Proactive Response Activation:** Based on the received notification, automotive manufacturers can quickly assess the impact on their production schedules. They can determine whether the disruption affects specific models or production lines and initiate contingency plans, such as activating alternative suppliers or adjusting production schedules to minimize the impact. The mentioned consequences and measures are not part of the "Supply Chain Disruption Notification" feature, but can be initiated significantly faster than without the feature.
1. **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** The standardized notification format allows for quick understanding and response from all impacted stakeholders (i.e. notification recipients). For instance, if a particular model is heavily affected, manufacturers can collaborate with suppliers to explore rapid procurement alternatives or adjust orders based on the real-time data provided in the notification.
1. **Feedback Loop:** As the situation evolves, the supplier continues to provide updates through the notification system, ensuring all impacted stakeholders have the latest information to make informed decisions. This ongoing communication fosters a collaborative environment where manufacturers and suppliers work together to mitigate the disruption's effects.
1. **Resolution**: As soon as the situation is finalized (e.g. solution found, crisis over, measures effective), the sender updates all impacted stakeholders through the notification system. This ensures, that all stakeholders have the latest status and can take corresponding decisions.

#### Impact And Benefits

This use case demonstrates the vital role of the "Supply Chain Disruption Notifications" standard in enhancing the agility and resilience of the automotive supply chain.

## Business Process

The Supply Chain Disruption Notifications standard orchestrates significant business processes within the Catena-X network, aiming to enhance the industries' resilience to supply chain disruptions. These processes facilitate timely and efficient communication among stakeholders, ensuring a coordinated response to disruptions. Here's an overview of the roles and processes involved:

**Actors and Roles:**

- **Notification Senders:** Entities that detect and report disruptions within the supply chain, acting as the primary source of real-time disruption information.
- **Notification Recipient:** Stakeholders who receive the disruption notifications, needing to adjust their operations or decision-making in response to the reported disruptions.

**Potential Triggers:**

Supply Chain Disruption Notifications are recommended for exceptional circumstances and are not intended for routine communication regarding changes in demands or capacities. For the latter the usage of the DCM and the PURIS KIT/Apps is recommended. As outlined, these notifications are specifically deployed in response to extraordinary events that significantly impact the supply chain. The determination of what constitutes an "extraordinary" event is at the discretion of the sender. Below is a list of potential triggers for issuing a Supply Chain Disruption Notification:

- **Affected Period:** An assessment indicating that the issue or situation will have a long-term impact that cannot be resolved within a defined period of weeks or persists over an extended duration.
- **Duration:** Duration of capacity reduction or change in demand, such as whether capacity is diminished over a specified period.
- **Degree of Deviation:** The degree of capacity loss or demand change is typically addressed in the normal failure batch by setting user capacity to zero. However, if significant changes occur, an alert may be triggered.
- **Affected number of business partners:** Assessment indicates that the problem or situation will impact additional business partners beyond the direct 1:1 business relationship and cannot be resolved solely within that relationship.

**Data Exchange and Notification Transmission:**

- **Disruption Information:** Detailed notifications about the nature, scope, and expected impact of the disruption, including estimated duration and affected materials or components if already known/identified.
- **Impact Assessment:** Recipients evaluate the potential impact of the disruption on their operations, considering factors like inventory levels, production schedules, and delivery commitments. Further, they evaluate if they need to inform their partners via a new notification.
- **Response Coordination:** Facilitates a collaborative approach among impacted stakeholders to develop and implement mitigation strategies, ensuring a unified response to the disruption.

**Key Processes:**

- **Direct Notification:** Immediate dissemination of disruption information from the sender to all relevant recipients (limited to 1-up/1-down) within the network.
- **Collaborative Resolution:** Stakeholders work together to address the disruption, sharing insights and potential solutions to mitigate the impact across the supply chain.
- **Update and Feedback Loop:** Continuous updates on the evolving status of the disruption and its resolution, enabling stakeholders to adapt their strategies in real-time.

**Operational Adaptation:**

- **Proactive Adjustment:** Stakeholders use the received information to proactively adjust production plans, inventory management, and logistical arrangements.
- **Strategic Planning:** Incorporation of disruption data into strategic planning, enhancing the supply chain's agility and preparedness for future disruptions.

**Notification Identifiers:**

To differentiate messages and maintain chronological and dependence tracking, distinct IDs are included in the notifications sent:

- **Notification ID:** Unique ID identifying the notification.
- **Related Notification ID:** Unique ID identifying a previously received notification triggering the exchange of the current notification.
- **Source Notification ID:** Unique ID identifying a source notification related to the current one.

The business process underpinned by the "Supply Chain Disruption Notifications" standard empowers partners within the Catena-X network to respond effectively to unexpected disruptions. This system enhances the industry's ability to maintain operational continuity, mitigate risks, and uphold service levels, contributing to a more resilient and responsive automotive supply chain.

## Logic And Schema by Example

To send and receive Supply Chain Disruption Notifications, an internal process for evaluating incoming notifications as well as sending new notifications needs to be implemented. The following figure visualizes the process in the supply chain, in which a tier 3 company sends a notification to its customers and a supplier.

![Logic and Schema](resources/notifications-forwarding-example.drawio.svg)
_Figure 2: Visualization of the notifications process with forwarding into two directions from the source disruption._

Table 2 gives an overview about the partners present in the supply chain and directly links to the section describing how the partners handle the situation.

| Partner              | Produces         | Delivers to        | Receives from                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Tier 4.1             | steel sheets     | Tier 3.1           | -                                      |
| [Tier 3.1](#tier-31) | nuts             | Tier 2.1, Tier 2.2 | Tier 4.1                               |

| [Tier 1.2](#tier-12) | steering wheel   | OEM 1, OEM 2       | Tier 2.1, Tier 2.2                     |
| OEM1                 | Car 1            | -                  | Tier 1.2, Tier 1.1 (ignored in sample) |
| OEM2                 | Car 2            | -                  | Tier 1.2                               |

Table 2: _Summary of the supply network affected by the disruption._

### Tier 3.1

The example starts with _Tier 3.1_ who is a nut producing company. A lightning strikes into one of his production sites. As a result, a fire started. The production site has not fully been burnt down but may not be operated for the next weeks. Thus, _Tier 3.1_ evaluates the impact on his customers and suppliers. After the analysis, he creates a `Supply Chain Disruption Notification` to inform these partners. All notifications sent, will receive the same `source disruption id` as the lightning is the disruption source. _Tier 3.1_ generates an id for this.

#### Impact on Tier 4.1

_Tier 3.1_ wants to inform his partner about it. _Tier 3.1_ sends a notification with the following explicit information:

- start date disruption: today as the disruption started today
- status: `open` as the production issue at _Tier 3.1_ is still in place
- expected end date disruption: + two weeks as _Tier 3.1_ estimates to be fully recovered then.
- source disruption id: id set by Tier 3.1 for all notifications related to this disruption.
- related notification id: kept empty as this message is the originating message.

#### Impact on Tier 2.1

_Tier 3.1_ wants to inform his partner about it. _Tier 3.1_ sends a notification with the following explicit information:

- start date disruption: today as the disruption started today
- status: `open` as the production issue at _Tier 3.1_ is still in place
- expected end date disruption: + two weeks as _Tier 3.1_ estimates to be fully recovered then.
- source disruption id: id set by Tier 3.1 for all notifications related to this disruption.
- related notification id: kept empty as this message is the originating message.

#### Impact on Tier 2.2

Based on current orders, only one week will be covered by remaining material in transit and in stock. Thus, _Tier 3.1_ informs _Tier 2.2_ that he'll work on resolving it with the following explicit information:

- start date disruption: today as the disruption started today
- status: open as the production issue at _Tier 3.1_ is still in place
- expected end date disruption: + two weeks as _Tier 3.1_ estimates to be fully recovered then.
- source disruption id: id set by Tier 3.1 for all notifications related to this disruption.
- related notification id: kept empty as this message is the originating message.

### Tier 2.1

_Tier 2.1_ produces airbag modules for which nuts are also delivered to connect the airbag to the steering wheel later on. For some logistics delays and orders that have not yet been placed but soon will. The disruption will affect _Tier 1.2_ starting in three weeks. Following information are explained explicitly:

- start date disruption: + three weeks as explained above.
- status: open as the production issue at _Tier 3.1_ is still in place
- expected end date disruption: start date disruption + two weeks as _Tier 3.1_ estimates to be affected for 2 weeks.
- source disruption id: copied from `sourceDisruptionId` from message received.
- related notification id: copied from `notificationId` from message received.

### Tier 2.2

_Tier 2.2_ produces steering linkages for which nuts are also delivered to connect the linkage to the wheel. If demand is not raised, safety stocks and material in transit will be sufficient. Following information are explained explicitly:

- start date disruption: today as the disruption started today
- status: `open` as the production issue at _Tier 3.1_ is still in place
- expected end date disruption: + two weeks as the same timeframe applies as for _Tier 3.1_'s incident.
- source disruption id: copied from `sourceDisruptionId` from message received.
- related notification id: copied from `notificationId` from message received.

:::info[Align with your partners in which cases to send notifications!]
_Tier 2.2_ and _Tier 1.2_ previously aligned on the scenarios in which they want to inform each other about disruptions. They aligned on being very transparent, and defined to inform partners about significant issues that might impact each other. Within the text fields they state their analysis. Based on their alignment, _Tier 2.2_ will send an update whenever new information is available and send an update with `status` set to `resolved` after actually resolving the disruption.
:::

### Tier 1.2

_Tier 1.2_ receives the messages from _Tier 2.1_ and _Tier 2.2_ within one hour delay. Thus, he can consider already both notifications prior to informing his customers. _Tier 1.2_ single-sourced the airbag module and thus needs to inform _OEM 1_ that he will be affected and work on it. Following information are explained explicitly:

- start date disruption: + three weeks as received from _Tier 2.1_.
- status: `open` as the production issue at _Tier 3.1_ is still in place
- expected end date disruption: + 5 weeks as received from _Tier 2.1_.
- source disruption id: copied from `sourceDisruptionId` from messages received. This is always the same.
- related notification id: copied from `notificationId` from messages received.

:::note
The notification Tier 1.2 to OEM 2 is ignored in this example for the sake of redundancy.

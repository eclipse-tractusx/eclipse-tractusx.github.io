### Example Use Case

#### Streamlining Disruption Management in Automotive Manufacturing

The automotive industry, particularly in the context of increasing complexity and interconnectivity in supply chains, faces significant challenges in managing disruptions.

Consider a scenario where an unexpected disruption occurs in the supply of aluminum, a critical material for vehicle manufacturing. This disruption could arise from various factors such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or logistical challenges, impacting multiple manufacturers and their production lines. The aluminum producer (sender) must evaluate the impact and identify which products and stakeholders are affected. If the impact is significant, the sender will communicate the current situation upstream in a notification, potentially informing its supplier as well. Another scenario would be that an OEM notifies their suppliers about a significant demand increase which then potentially goes down the supply chain.

For both scenarios, the recipient of this notification reviews the content and assesses the impact on their operations. Based on this assessment, the recipient determines whether further stakeholders need to be informed (either one level up or down the supply chain). If additional notifications are necessary, the recipient, now acting as the sender, drafts a new message (including a UID for the original message) to inform subsequent recipients. These recipients then evaluate the impact on their own operations and decide if further notifications are required.

In this context, the "Supply Chain Disruption Notifications" plays a significant role in addressing these challenges by facilitating swift and standardized communication of supply chain disruptions.

1. **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** The standardized notification format allows for quick understanding and response from all impacted stakeholders (i.e. notification recipients). For instance, if a particular model is heavily affected, manufacturers can collaborate with suppliers to explore rapid procurement alternatives or adjust orders based on the real-time data provided in the notification.
1. **Feedback Loop:** As the situation evolves, the supplier continues to provide updates through the notification system, ensuring all impacted stakeholders have the latest information to make informed decisions. This ongoing communication fosters a collaborative environment where manufacturers and suppliers work together to mitigate the disruption's effects.
1. **Resolution**: As soon as the situation is finalized (e.g. solution found, crisis over, measures effective), the sender updates all impacted stakeholders through the notification system. This ensures, that all stakeholders have the latest status and can take corresponding decisions.

## Material Accounting

### Introduction

#### Material Accounting: Enabling Transparency in the Circular Economy to Validate Material Loops

In the dynamic landscape of modern industry, the pursuit of a circular economy has become increasingly vital. This transformative approach seeks to minimize waste and enhance resource efficiency by promoting the reuse, recycling and repurposing of materials throughout their entire lifecycle. However, the realization of a truly circular economy faces significant challenges, primarily stemming from the absence of standardized data exchange and communication among the diverse network of stakeholders involved in the process.

Currently, there is a notable absence of a uniform data format or exchange mechanism for recycled materials within industrial processes and value chains. This lack of transparency presents a barrier to comprehending the flow of materials and recycled materials circulating within this ecosystem. Without a standardized approach, tracking the contributions of recycled materials, assessing their successful reintegration into the circular loop, and quantifying output volumes remain challenging tasks.

The circular economy involves a complex interplay of various stakeholders, ranging from tier-n companies to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), each employing unique methods for measuring inputs and outputs. The overarching objective of the material accounting feature in the Circularity KIT, therefore, is to make the circular economy visible and digitally verifiable across the automotive value chain.

To realize this ambition, a standardized framework is imperative, one that facilitates the exchange of material data for both primary and secondary raw materials, including corresponding quantities and qualities, illuminating material flows across the entire value chain.

The image below shows the big picture of a circular economy when material is tracked over its complete life cycle excluding the usage phase.

##### Figure 2

![Overview Material flow](resources/adoption-view/overview_material_flow.svg)

### Business Value

From a business perspective, the material accounting KIT is characterized by the following attributes:

1. **Standardized Data Exchange:** Facilitation of standardized data exchange regarding scrap, waste, and secondary materials among ecosystem partners.
2. **Verifiable Closed Loops:** The KIT enables the establishment of verifiable closed loops for material tracking.
3. **Increased Material Recycling:** The KIT promotes the recycling of materials within the same industry, increasing sustainability.
4. **Transparency:** It provides higher transparency regarding the availability of secondary materials.

### Use Case / Domain Explanation

#### Material Accounting in Catena-X

Catena-X offers a decentral, sovereign, cross-organizational data exchange. For Material Accounting the following scenario could be addressed: Registering secondary materials as decentral digital twins in the Catena-X network based on material batches.

The goal of the Material Accounting Feature inside the Catena-X consortium and association is to collaborate on exchanging standardized secondary material information across the upstream & downstream value in order to develop a standardized data model. To do so, we identified potential data points along a closed loop with OEM, recycler and supplier as stakeholders as seen in the picture below. Further feature content will follow in upcoming versions of the Circularity KIT.

![Data Points along the Value Chain](resources/adoption-view/datapoints_along_valuechain.svg)

## Secondary Material Content

### Introduction

_Introducing the Secondary Material Framework within the Circularity KIT by Catena-X: Enhancing Sustainability and Communication in the Automotive Value Chain._

In the pursuit of sustainability and resource efficiency, the automotive industry is continuously exploring innovative ways to incorporate secondary materials into its value chain. At the forefront of this endeavor is the secondary material framework, a pivotal component of Catena-X's Circularity KIT.

Designed with a clear mission, this framework seeks to revolutionize the utilization of secondary materials throughout the automotive value chain, extending its impact to tier-n companies and OEMs alike. Through a multi-faceted approach, the secondary material framework not only optimizes accessibility to secondary material information but also advances collaboration and communication among diverse stakeholders within the industry.

By facilitating seamless data exchange and introducing standardized calculation methodologies, this framework establishes a transparent foundation that harmonizes communication among stakeholders by employing consistent metrics. The decentralized nature of this data ecosystem empowers each actor to manage their own data and determine what can be shared with whom.

The secondary material content chapter of the Circularity KIT explores how the secondary material framework contributes to heightened transparency, empowered data management, and streamlined communication, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and interconnected automotive ecosystem.

### Business Context

#### Use Case / Domain Explanation

This user journey illustrates the data exchange process through Catena-X in the context of secondary material content. The user journey outlines the various stakeholders along the value chain and within the individual tiers and their involvement.

##### Figure 4

![User Journey - SMC](resources/adoption-view/userJourney_smc.svg)

The user journey follows the same process during all four lifecycle stages and differ in data quality as stated below. Further information to the lifecycle stages can be found in the [Traceability KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Traceability%20Kit/Business%20View%20Traceability%20Kit/).

| Lifecycle Stage | Explanation                                                                                       | Example                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As Designed     | Development phase: **Initial estimation** of secondary material content                           | The company that wishes to procure a component requires an initial estimate from the supplier regarding the elements of the SMC.                                                  |
| As Planned      | Planning phase: **Concretization** of the secondary material content                              | The company chooses a supplier based on the proposals received and obtains more detailed information about the SMC as the supplier can plan the component with greater precision. |
| As Ordered      | Ordering phase: Calculation of secondary material content on the **basis of supplied components** | The ordering phase occurs before the start of production, allowing for the calculation of the SMC information based on the specific parts and materials that are being supplied.  |
| As Built        | Production phase: Ongoing calculation **after start of production**                               | During the production process SMC information are regularly exchanged between supplier and OEM.                                                                                   |

### Semantic Models

There are different scenarios in which SMC Data can be exchanged. According to the semantic model framework, this implies that there is a specific data model for each purpose (scenario).

_To ensure efficiency by avoiding redundancy and maintaining multiple data models, the concept of a shared aspect model was used: This means that there is one Secondary Material “base model”, which is the SecondaryMaterialContent. This serves as an enabler for data modelling and not for data exchange itself, it is bad practice to use it for data exchange._

Instead, SecondaryMaterialContentCalculated or SecondaryMaterialContentVerifiable should be used when exchanging SMC data, depending on the actual scenario.

The main difference between these data models, is whether the data is based on assumptions or a prognosis and is therefore not fixed, in which case SecondaryMaterialContentCalculated is to be used. On the other hand, once the data is actually measured and can therefore be verified, the SecondaryMaterialContentVerifiable should be used. It is important to note that the models now include the same properties and can only be differentiated by the name of the relevant data model.

In the table below, different scenarios are described to clarify which data model is used in which case.

| Scenario                                     | Description                                                                                                                                   | Example from Practice                                                                                                             | Data Model                                                                                                                                                |

| Prognosis-based SMC data exchange            | In this scenario, SMC data is exchanged based on a prediction or forecast of future events in the automotive sector.                          | When the production of a previously produced car is continued, a prognosis of the SMC is made based on the previous production.   | [SecondaryMaterialContentCalculated](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.secondary_material_content_calculated) |
| Measured-information-based SMC data exchange | In this scenario, the SMC data that is exchanged is based on actual measured information and data. The relevant data is therefore verifiable. | During the production of a component, the order information of the used material clearly indicates the SMC of the used materials. | [SecondaryMaterialContentVerifiable](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.secondary_material_content_verifiable) |

The next part provides an overview of the secondary material content (SMC) calculation framework, including relevant data points, the calculation of SMC, and links to the data model and GitHub. The goal is to create a common basis for the data relevant for the SMC. Based on this, steering for secondary material content (SMC) and secondary material quota (SMQ) is possible.

#### A. Introduction to the Semantic Models

The semantic model is based on data points regarding material and order data.

There are different timestamps to which data for SMC is relevant.

To ensure the accuracy of the data and account for varying availability and quality of the information, it is important to identify at which step of the process data is exchanged. The process is divided into four steps, which are explained below.

In addition to filling out the data model for Secondary Material Content, other data models must also be completed to ensure adequate information and compatibility within Catena-X. During the As-Planned phase, the Part as Planned (Component) data model must be filled in addition to the SMC data model. Once the as-built phase is reached, the serial part (Component) data model must be filled to provide information as manufacturer partID, and customer partID. As such, these values are not included in the SMC data model.

#### 1. Material

The Model is designed to address the material at the lowest level requiring descriptive information, such as the material name in accordance with a standardized format, as well as the name and code of the referenced standard _(materialNameStandardizedValue; referencedStandard; referencedStandardID)._ For example, a material name may be given based on the ISO 1043 standard, in which case ISO would be the referenced standard and ‘1043’ the referenced standard ID. The material class _(materialClass)_ must be provided in accordance with the VDA standard 231-106. To provide relevant data regarding the material mass per declared unit of the material, the unit of measure, such as gram or kilogram _(unitOfMeasureKey)_, must first be defined. Next, the gross material input weight _(grossMaterialInputMass)_ as well as the net mass of the material _(materialNetMass)_ shall be provided.

Essential material characteristics that are mandatory within the data model include the use of bio-based materials and their material class _(bioBasedClass)_, as well as the percentage of material weight of each primary and secondary bio-based material _(primaryBioBased; secondaryBioBased)._ For secondary bio-based material it can be chosen whether a mass balancing approach was followed or not _(isMassBalanced)_. Further information on mass-balancing can be found under [_B. Accounting for chain of custody models_](#b-chain-of-custody-models).

Further, information regarding inorganic/fossil-based materials is required. The percentage of primary inorganic/fossil-based material weight _(percentageOfMaterialWeight)_ shall be provided. When it comes to secondary material, the percentage of material weight of chemically and mechanically recycled pre-consumer and post-consumer material according to ISO 14021 should be included _(percentageOfMaterialWeight)_. Post-Consumer material is divided into two streams: Post consumer material from end-of-life vehicles as well as post consumer from other sources. When chemical or mechanical recycling has been applied, it is important to disclose information whether a mass balancing approach was followed _(isMassBalanced)._

_Definition of pre-consumer material:_

“Material diverted from the waste stream during a manufacturing process. Excluded is reutilization of materials such as rework, regrind or scrap generated in a process and capable of being reclaimed within the same process that generated it. Pre consumer material can be used in form of recovered or recycled material as a substitute for primary material.”

_Definition of post-consumer material:_

“Material generated by households or by commercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as end-users of the product which can no longer be used for its intended purpose. This includes returns of material from the distribution chain. Post-consumer material can be used in form of recovered or recycled material as a substitute for primary material.”

#### Optional Information, such as Reutilization

Optional information can be included to enhance the quality of the provided data, such as the percentage of material weight of reutilization material content _(additionalInformation)_.

_Definition of Reutilization:_

“Reutilization of materials such as rework, regrind or scrap materials generated within the process and capable of being reused within the same process that generated it. Any operation by which products or components that are not waste are used again for the same purpose for which they were originally intended. Reutilization allows waste to be reduced and materials can be kept in the cycle.”

Even though Reutilization fosters the avoidance of waste, it does not count as recyclate according to ISO 14021 and is an optional attribute for this data model.

If available, the name of a certificate verifying the recycling content and a link to its PDF validating the provided information can be included _(certificate)._

##### Figure 6

![Material Characteristics](resources/adoption-view/Relationship_between_Material_Characteristics.svg)

The schematic depiction above provides a visual representation of the connection between various material characteristics, facilitating an understanding of how different data points relate to each other and contribute to the calculation of SMC.

#### 2. Order Data

To clearly identify the order and relevant material, the order number _(orderNumber)_ can be provided on an optional basis.

#### B. Chain of Custody Models

Disclaimer: For information regarding the calculation of a PCF on basis of the Chain of Custody Models please see the Catena-X [(PCF) Rulebook.](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library)

Chain of custody is an administrative process by which information about materials is transferred, monitored, and controlled as those materials move through supply chains [ISO 22095:2020]. There are in principle four chains of custody models possible, illustrated in the figure below. Their common objective is to guarantee correct bookkeeping and to corroborate a link between in-going content, e.g., ‘sustainable’, ‘recycled’ or ‘organic’ by harmonized definitions, and the finally out-going product. They differ regarding physical or administrative links. Furthermore, they differ on the set of rules for balancing, and the possibility to keep materials streams segregated or not.

Explanation chain of custody models [adapted from the above cited EMF Whitepaper]

The mass balance approach helps enabling fossil raw materials to be replaced by more sustainable alternative materials (e.g. with recycled content, bio-content). In contrast to a segregated use of alternative raw materials, mass balance enables to use existing production networks with minimized or no investments into new process technologies and production facilities. A book and claim model can be applied when there is no direct connection between the final product and the certified supply. An example for a book and claim model is applied in green electricity markets and receives more attention in other sectors as a way to support circular transformation of the industry, therefore it is accepted as a solution. There will be a regular review by Catena-X to decide about the further necessity.

#### Guiding Principles

In implementing chain-of-custody methods, including the mass balance one, the following set of guiding principles shall be fulfilled:

1. The use of chain-of-custody approaches shall achieve significant changes and an effective transition towards a more circular, more bio-based and lower GHG emissions production in complex value chains.
2. The choice and implementation of chain-of-custody approaches and models shall be transparent, clear, and credible – abiding by relevant standards such as ISO and CEN. Such credibility can also be achieved but is not limited to accepted third-party certification schemes, e.g. ISCC PLUS, REDCert2 and RSB.

   Note: Certification Schemes are not yet available in all sectors.

3. Labels and claims referring to chain-of-custody controlled specified characteristics and used on products shall fulfill the following requirements:

   - description of the chain-of-custody approaches and models
   - accurate and appropriate implementation of the chain-of-custody model
   - compliant with existing standards and regulations
   - non-misleading

   In case the “specified characteristic” content in products cannot be measured and verified, labels and claims products may reflect this in ways that clearly differentiate and specify the actual content.

4. No double counting: A reliable bookkeeping system shall be installed at each operating site to avoid the sales of a greater amount of alternative attributed products than physically available in the company.

   Additional requirements for mass balance chain of custody approach:

5. The operating sites in the spatial boundaries for mass balancing are under the operational control of the same company/corporate group/joint venture.

6. It shall be technically possible according to standard industry practice to produce a mass balanced product from an alternative feedstock. The share of mass-balanced material can be technically lower than the attributed share.

7. Applied emissions factors for the mass balance system boundaries shall be material and process specific.

For the SMC data model, information whether a mass-balanced approach has been applied or not can be provided in the data model.

#### C. Calculation Logic for SMC

The secondary material quota (SMQ) is a KPI measuring the usage of secondary materials within a vehicle. A vehicle can be defined as the sum of its individual components. Therefore, the secondary material content (SMC) is defined as the ratio between secondary material used and total material used on component level. To enable steering for secondary material content on the component level, it is important to establish a common understanding of the SMC of a single material. Based on the data model and information provided earlier, the SMC of a material can be calculated. The SMC can be divided into different pillars: Pre-consumer material and Post-consumer material and, optional: Reutilization material content

All secondary material usage types are being expressed as percentages of the relationship between secondary materials and total materials used.

##### 1. Pre-consumer material content

![pre consumer material content equation](resources/adoption-view/eq_pre_consumer_material_content.svg)

_Definition of pre-consumer material:_

“Material diverted from the waste stream during a manufacturing process. Excluded is reutilization of materials such as rework, regrind or scrap generated in a process and capable of being reclaimed within the same process that generated it. Pre consumer material can be used in form of recovered or recycled material as a substitute for primary material.”

##### 2. Post-consumer material content

![post consumer material content equation](resources/adoption-view/eq_post_consumer_material_content.svg)

_Definition of post-consumer material:_

“Material generated by households or by commercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as end-users of the product which can no longer be used for its intended purpose. This includes returns of material from the distribution chain. Post-consumer material can be used in form of recovered or recycled material as a substitute for primary material.”

##### 3. Optional: Reutilization content

![Reutilization content Equation](resources/adoption-view/equation_Reutilization_content.svg)

###### Definition of reutilization

“Reutilization of materials such as rework, regrind, or scrap materials generated within the process and capable of being reused within the same process that generated it. Any operation by which products or components that are not waste are used again for the same purpose for which they were originally intended. Reutilization allows waste to be reduced and materials can be kept in cycle.”

#### SMC and SMQ Calculation

The SMC calculates as the sum of the above defined secondary material usage types:

![SMC Equation](resources/adoption-view/equation_SMC.svg)

In the above-described manner, the secondary material content is to be calculated for every component of the vehicle.

The SMQ as a KPI defined on vehicle level which is calculated based on the individual SMC’s of the respective components:

![SMQ Equation](resources/adoption-view/equation_SMQ.svg)

It is important to note that data quality may vary during different stages of the process, and this should be taken into consideration to ensure the highest level of data accuracy.

To calculate the average portion of, for instance, the amount of mechanical recycling of post-consumer material content in the whole material, the values along the data model must be multiplied. For example, the content of inorganic or fossil-based material, content of secondary inorganic or fossil-based material, post-consumer material content, and mechanical recycling would be multiplied as can be seen in the schematic depiction below.

## End of Life / Dismantling Services

### Introduction

#### Closing Loops, Preserving Resources: Creating tomorrow's EoL landscape and empower the circularity

As part of the Circularity KIT, we are committed to developing services for the future of the circular economy in the end-of-life (EoL) sector of vehicles. This phase represents an important stage where decisions are made regarding the fate of vehicles and their components after their initial use. Recognizing the immense value of the world's limited resources, we are dedicated to minimizing waste and maximizing resource efficiency.

One of our key strategies involves creating a framework for an improved communication among all stakeholders involved in the EoL phase. This collaborative approach allows us to consider the needs and requirements of all participants, facilitating the collection and exchange of essential information. Importantly, we view the end of a vehicle's life as the beginning of a new one in the context of resource conservation.

Our overarching vision is to create a landscape that closes loops and preserves resources, ultimately empowering circularity in the industry. We aspire to provide digitized and scalable EoL services that align with circular economy principles and prioritize the preservation of components and materials. Simultaneously, we are committed to follow present and future changes in laws and regulations, which emphasizes environmentally friendly vehicle disposal and the recovery of critical raw materials (CRMs), aligning with the growing demand for closing component and material loops.

Our mission centres on empowering EoL and maintenance stakeholders by fostering continuous collaboration within the Catena-X Network and beyond. Through the Circularity KIT working group, we aim to develop and align various means, including data, business, and network models, to empower all stakeholders involved in the EoL phase. This mission is closely tied to our vision of promoting digitized and scalable end-of-life services across the industry while upholding the principles of circular economy.

Our strategy for achieving these goals involves several key steps. Firstly, we aim to enable EoL service models through data sharing based on digital twins (DT). This approach allows for efficient information sharing in an interoperable, standardized manner, which, in turn, supports dismantling and recycling operations. Furthermore, we are actively engaging with all relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, product designers (for circularity), and EoL service providers, to promote new "R-approaches" and facilitate their implementation.

Ultimately, our efforts provide essential support for the digitalization and automation of the EoL phase, with the ultimate goal of closing loops in the automotive sector. Through these digitized and scalable EoL services, we aim to contribute significantly to sustainable development and resource conservation, aligning with the principles of the circular economy.

### Business Context

#### Data Journey "End-of-Life"

The "Data Journey" represents the entire process of dismantling an End-of-Life (EoL) vehicle. Each process step is accompanied by CX data models that would be necessary for digitally representing the individual process steps. This enables us to elevate the data journey for the dismantling process to a digital level and to gain an understanding of which data attributes and aspect models are required for each process step. It forms the foundation for the creation of digital EoL-solutions and the use of robotics.

##### Figure 9

![Data Journey - End of LIfe](resources/adoption-view/figure_dataJourney_EOF.svg)

Future additions include data models for the following topics:

- Decommissioning Certificate
- Material for Recycling
- Adress Aspects
- ID Conversion
- Certificate of Dismantler
- Diagnostic Data
- Physical dimensions
- Mandatory dismantling
- Demand request
- Compatibility of components/ Design changes history
- Quality issue history
- Technical drawings & specifications
- PCF Information

#### User Journey "Certificate of Decomissioning"

The user journey "Certificate of Decommissioning" (CoDM) describes the moment at which a vehicle is transferred into the End-of-Life (EoL) phase from the perspective of an authorized collection point for EoL-vehicles, such as an authorized dismantling facility. The CoDM resembles the official Certificate of Destruction (CoD) but marks the starting point of the upcoming CX concept of a digital CoD.

## CE-Assistant

### Introduction

#### Empowering Circular Economy Decisions: Introducing the Circular Strategy Assistant

In the dynamic landscape of sustainability and resource conservation, the Circular Strategy Assistant (CE-Assistant) emerges as a pioneering solution, providing decision support for the selection of optimal strategies concerning end-of-life vehicles. At its core, the CE-Assistant tackles the task of evaluating and choosing from a spectrum of R-Strategies—namely Reuse, Remanufacturing, Recycling, and Recovery.

Rooted within the principles of Catena-X, the CE-Assistant is deeply aligned with a comprehensive assessment process that guides its functionality. This process is chiefly anchored in the Catena-X Digital Twin Framework, which encapsulates the essence of virtual representation and real-world insights.

Central to this endeavor is the CE-Assistant—a set of standards, aspect models, APIs, system architectures, and decision logics—all designed to foster the development of data-centric, Catena-X compliant decision support systems for Circular Economy Strategies. The core circularity lies in the orchestrated flow of engineering information—a collaborative effort involving entities across the automotive value chain.

The concept of Digital Twin (DT) serves as the backbone, offering a holistic virtual counterpart of assets. Defined with precision, the DT embodies a set of unique identifiers, an evolving spectrum of aspects, connectivity to diverse data sources, and the capacity to traverse the entire lifecycle of assets, encapsulating both individual and fleet-level knowledge.

In accordance with IDSA and Gaia-X principles, interconnectivity and data sovereignty, the CE-Assistant thrives on the principles of interoperability, substantiated by the Connector KIT (EDC) and Data Chain KIT (Item Relationship Service - IRS).

Undeniably, the selection of Circular Economy Strategies necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of emissions, natural resource preservation, energy management, and waste reduction. However, the effectiveness of such evaluation’s hinges on access to granular data encompassing the vehicle’s history, components, materials, and condition.

This is precisely where the CE-Assistant can help by supporting a user-centered approach that bridges the gap between data availability and informed decision-making. By offering transparency into the environmental implications of diverse circular economy strategies, the CE-Assistant facilitates swifter, well-informed, and efficient decisions rooted in the digital twin's insights.

### Business Context

The CE-Assistant provides decision support and circular strategies, enabling several key features for businesses:

1. **Component-Level Decision Support:** The KIT provides decision support for selecting circular strategies at the component level.
2. **Efficient Data-Driven Decisions:** Users can make faster and more efficient decisions based on data analysis.
3. **Enhanced Circularity:** The KIT contributes to increasing the circularity of products and meeting reuse quotas.
4. **Sustainability Milestones:** It helps achieve sustainability indicators and goals.
5. **Transparency on Secondary Materials:** The KIT offers transparency regarding the availability of secondary materials.
6. **Streamlined Vehicle Dismantling:** It optimizes the process of vehicle dismantling for improved resource recovery.

#### Use Case / Domain Explanation

The User Journey describes the system interaction of the CE Assistant with the user, the Dismantling Lead, with the aim of providing a recommendation for a component-level circular strategy for end-of-life vehicles. This involves breaking down the process of holistic decision-making into individual process steps and identifying the interaction with the user/system at each process step.

##### End-of-life decision support to enable circular economy in the automotive industry based on digital twin data

- **Abstract**: With the EU Green Deal and the UN Sustainable Developments Goals, the vision of a greenhouse gas-neutral and resource-efficient economy is already firmly anchored in world politics. In this context, the automotive industry faces many challenges including the increasing scarcity of natural resources, a rising demand in terms of sustainable vehicle design, production and materials sourcing. Due to all this, end-of-life decisions regarding dismantling have become increasingly important. A high proportion of secondary materials will be required in the vehicles of the future. To response to these challenges, companies have turned their focus towards the circular economy as a central approach to close material loops. In the German research project “Catena-X” a new data ecosystem with digital twins is one enabler that is being developed. The digital twins represent a promising approach to the circular economy by ensuring transparent, product-specific and end-to-end data exchange throughout the entire product lifecycle, from the material sourcing to the eventual dismantling and recycling. As one particular and unique solution, a decision framework that facilitates the best circular strategy at the end of a vehicle's life is developed and presented in this paper. The underlying data-driven decision support framework is based on circular economy KPIs. This includes material, components and specific vehicle KPIs to best identify the most suitable circular strategy. The framework was methodologically developed by an interdisciplinary team of partners, who are stakeholders throughout the value chain and participants in the Catena-X project. An integrated approach of user-centered design, an adapted version of the V-model and the Scaled Agile Framework were used for the methodology in the development of the solution. The paper presents the concept of a digital twin for a decision support system, that includes a central decision logic that also includes the relevant KPIs and a survey for evaluating the decision logic utilized with a chosen dismantling company.

##### Empowering End-of-Life Vehicle Decision Making with Cross-Company Data Exchange and Data Sovereignty via Catena-X

- **Abstract:** The mobility sector is the world’s second-largest producer of energy-related CO2 emissions, and it is facing a global resource shortage. The demand for circular products, the use of secondary materials in future vehicles, and the need for sustainable business models in the mobility sector is increasing. However, a transparent and end-to-end data exchange throughout the entire value network is missing, which is hindering an efficient circular economy. Relevant information on the vehicle, its components and materials at the end of the product life cycle are often missing. In this context, this paper presents a decision support system based on Digital Twin data for a circular economy solution as a software application. It was developed within the German research project Catena-X following an integrated approach of user-centered design, the V-model, and within the Scaled Agile Framework. By combining these methodological approaches, customer-oriented solutions were developed and continuously improved at each stage of development to shorten the time-to-market. Catena-X is based on Gaia-X principles. In Gaia-X, necessary core services are developed, and contraction negotiation for data exchange and usage policies is enabled and implemented. The decision support system provides important information about the exact composition and condition of the vehicle, its components, and its materials. Thus, it helps to improve efficiency, sustainability, and the implementation of the circular economy. The decision support system was tested and validated with a use case that provided Digital Twin data on the end-of-life vehicle.

##### Digital Twins for Circular Economy - Enabling Decision Support for R-Strategies

- **Abstract:** Digital twins (DT) for circular economy (CE) offer a promising approach as part of digital data ecosystems for more sustainable value creation. By mapping and analyzing product, component and material specific data along the lifecycle, it is possible to address current challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity. Within Catena-X, specific solutions based on this cross-company exchanged data and information are developed. Here, the “CE-Assistant” is presented. It is an application, which identifies the best CE-Strategy based on DT data at the end of a vehicle's life.
- **Link:** [OA_Mügge_6-2022 | INDUSTRIE-MANAGEMENT](https://www.industrie-management.de/node/556)

#### Logic / Schema

In order to evaluate which R-Strategy can be applied to individual components, instance-specific data must be available. This is ensured using DT data throughout the product lifecycle. Such an DT enables the collection of instance-specific data on the product, and thus provides the missing EoL data for vehicle disassembly.

Depending on the decision-making step, instance specific data for the vehicle disassembly is partly necessary or product specific data is sufficient. Decision support regarding the best R-Strategy is preceded by the logic for the technical feasibility. Thus, only when the R-Strategy is technically feasible, it must be checked for other indicators.

The outcome of the technical feasibility is to analyze if an R-Strategy has to be excluded at the beginning based on regulatory requirements regarding an R-Strategy or a defect in functionality of specific components.

The process is started by entering the vehicle identification number (VIN) into the system, thereby requesting the corresponding Catena-X data. The registered companies in the Catena-X network act as data providers for this vehicle-specific data, as they register respective assets and sub-models. Catena-X Shared Services handle existing data models, contract, usage and access control policies, and ultimately the final data exchange.

The system shows the first information, such as corresponding vehicle, component and material based on data from the DT. This data is provided for the first overall manual inspection and evaluation. After that, the user selects the most relevant components for the R-Strategy decision. The decision logic is applied for this component and the possible R-Strategies are identified.

The core process means in a chronological order: The basic reuse-potential, material composition and remaining lifetime in comparison with the specific thresholds and the disassembly capability.

If one or more of these criteria are not fulfilled, the component will only be assigned to recovery or recycling. If the component qualifies for disassembly, a manual visual inspection and a functional check are conducted. For components, where the visual condition is relevant, such as body parts and interior components, the visual inspection is conducted first. In contrast, components, for which the technical condition is of significant relevance, such as engines and gearboxes, are first subjected to a functional test. Here, the data can also be provided in the Catena-X network as an update of the DT. Thereafter, a quality comparison of the component condition with threshold values takes place. When the quality is insufficient for reuse, the technical check for remanufacturing is carried out chronologically: Assimilability, cleanability and restorability/upgradability. Finally, a possible strategy is given to the user as a result.

## Secondary Marketplace

### Introduction

A secondary marketplace is fundamental to establish a circular economy where components and materials are available and offered to the interested users creating new value chains and extending the life of the parts and the materials before becoming waste. Digital platforms offering marketplace services are essential to enable trading of secondary materials and components, provide transparency into supply and demand that potential buyers and sellers can expect.

The main goals of the Marketplace are: (1) to match the demand and the supply of available components and secondary raw materials and (2) to provide transparency on sales opportunities for used components which can be, for example, reused or re-manufactured.

If offered, additional services such as grading, certifications for the offered listings (components or secondary materials) and transport handling and logistics could support trading processes.

### Business Context

A secondary marketplace enables closing the loop on economical and physical layers. Following the logic described in the previous chapter, there could be multiple scenarios related to R-strategies on how secondary marketplaces enable a circular economy.

Potential sales scenarios:

- Dismantling companies selling old components and material/scrap;
- Automotive manufacturers selling old unused components;
- Automotive manufacturers selling production waste and scrap;
- and others.

Potential purchase scenarios:

- Automotive companies buying components for re-manufacturing;
- Workshops buying components for re-use;
- Recyclers buying production waste and scrap;
- and others.

In all of those cases, having additional information (e.g. product carbon footprint or digital product passport details) on the products offered on the marketplace is beneficial.

### User Journey and Architecture Overview

In general, there are several goals that buyers and sellers pursue on a secondary marketplace:

- As a (Core) Purchaser, I want to search and filter for market supply on OE number level to match the market offers towards my demand.
- As a (Core) Purchaser, I want to reach as many possible sellers as possible to purchase parts that I cannot procure today. This includes brokers I don't buy from today.
- As a (Core) Seller, I want to place offers on the marketplace with standard upload tools and manually.
- As a (Core) Seller, I want to reach as many possible customers as possible to maximize my turnover. This includes customers I don't sell to today.

The key user journey relevant in Catena-X circular economy area relates to the need of a buyer to have full reliable information on a product that he is intending to purchase. This is especially important given that many buyers are looking for parts for re-manufacturing or re-use, where product quality plays a vital role. Furthermore, in case of recycling, recyclers are interested to know material composition and additional information that would influence their purchasing decision.

Some information could be provided by a variety of data models, but the highest value lies within the generic digital product passport (and by extension, battery passport, sealant passport, transmission passport). When a seller is publishing a listing with a product that he is willing to sell, there is only a limited amount of information he can provide with it, mostly the one available from the visual inspection or on-board data (such as mileage, OE-number, brand) as well as logistical/ sales information (such as location or price). When a potential buyer views the listing, he should have a possibility to request additional details from a data provider of the generic digital product passport (if available) for that product (see diagram below). More information on the digital product passport can be found in the [Ecopass KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/Eco_Pass_KIT/page-adoption-view/).

This process is reflected in the architecture for communicating with the Catena-X network and data providers of the battery passport data model, as presented below.

When it comes to the data exchange schema and other details, see the [Triangle for Secondary Marketplace](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library) document for more information on how such a request could be realized within Catena-X environment and according to applicable guidelines (e.g. on interoperability and data sovereignty). In a decentral environment, such attributes as manufacturer part ID and OE number play a vital role in order to get access to the right component and the right data model at data provider’s side.

### Semantic Models

In the following, relevant semantic models for the secondary marketplace are listed. For further information about the listed data models please refer to the Catena-X standards library for the respective data model, marked as “CX-“, which contains the standardized data models with further descriptions and explanations. The standards library can be founded here: [Catena-X Standard-Library](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library)

The Marketplace Offer is an aspect model that is complementary to the concept of a secondary marketplace. It described a product (e.g. a used, dismantled component) that is placed for sale onto the marketplace, with key supporting information such as quantity, quality, or price. It provides essential information for potential buyers and could be used in the future to exchange product information between multiple marketplaces. This model can therefore be used to exchange offers between multiple marketplaces. As there is no exchange scenario defined yet, the Marketplace Offer is a recommendation and non-normative, since it is so far concerning the business application-internal data structure only. More information on this aspect model can be found under CX-0035 in the standards library or under the following link: [Marketplace Offer](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.market_place_offer)

Additionally, two other aspect models could play a supporting role for secondary marketplaces.

The Return Request aspect model could be used to flag a vehicle or product to indicate that there is a demand or a request for return. It specifies the aspect of the recall of a vehicle part and thus provides the information whether and why a return request exists for a product. More information on this aspect model can be found under CX-0033 in the standards library or under the following link: [Return Request](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.return_request)

The Product Passport aspect model could provide reliable details on the product characteristics or lifecycle information, therefore complementing the basic Marketplace Offer information. More information on this aspect model can be found under CX-0103 in the standards library or under the following link: [Digital Product Passport](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport)

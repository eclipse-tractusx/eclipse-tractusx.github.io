| Aggregate State/ State of Matter         | State of matter (German: "Aggregatzustand") is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist. Three states of matter are observable at ambient conditions and free of electrical charge: solid, liquid, gas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | State of matter - Wikipedia                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Base Quantity                            | The International System of Quantities defines seven base quantities. The set of base quantities is chosen by convention where no base quantity can be expressed in terms of the others, but where every quantity in the system can be expressed in terms of the base quantities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | International System of Quantities - Wikipedia                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Chain-of-Custody approach                | Mass balance is one of several well-known chain of custody approaches that can be used to track the flow of materials through the value chain. The total quantity of the content in question is tracked through the production system and the allocation of this content is made to the end products based on verifiable accounting. The goal of this method is to ensure proper accounting and to confirm a link between the incoming content (e.g., "sustainable," "recycled," or "organic" according to some definition) and the eventual outgoing product. | [https://www.basf.com/global/documents/de/sustainability/we-source-responsibly/Mass-Balance-White-Paper-2020.pdf](https://www.basf.com/global/documents/de/sustainability/we-source-responsibly/Mass-Balance-White-Paper-2020.pdf) |
| Chemical Composition                     | Chemical composition refers to identity and number of the chemical elements that make up any particular chemical compound. In order to provide unambiguous information, "chemical element" and "chemical compound" must be defined as context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Chemical composition - Wikipedia                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Chemical Recycling                       | Chemical or feedstock recycling refers to the conversion of plastic polymers into their monomers or chemical building blocks or basic chemicals, i. e. depolymerisation by means of thermochemical or chemical processes, although there is currently no uniform, legally binding definition [13].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Background Paper on Chemical Recycling - German Environmental Agency, Dec 2020                                                                                                                                                     |
| Circular Economy                         | The circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. In this way, the life cycle of products is extended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | European Parliament                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Mass-Balancing                           | Considering the output, no physical or chemical difference exists between in-scope and out-of-scope. It involves balancing volume reconciliation to ensure the exact account of volumes of in- and out-of-scope source is maintained along the supply chain, provided that the volume or the ratio of sustainable material integrated is reflected in the product produced and sold to customers. This model requires that a reconciliation period is defined (e.g. a month, a year).                                                                          | PCF Rulebook                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Mechanical Recycling                     | End-of-life materials can be processed via collecting, sorting, shredding, melting and transforming it into secondary raw materials for a new application. This form of recycling involves processes in which e.g. the polymer structure is not significantly changed, and plastic is preserved as a material. Thus, in terms of its complexity, mechanical recycling takes place at a lower technical level than chemical recycling.                                                                                                                          | Mechanical recycling (basf.com)                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Remanufacturing                          | Remanufacturing is a standardized industrial process that restores used products to their original performance level or better, with a warranty equivalent to or surpassing that of newly manufactured products. The remanufacturing effort includes dismantling the product, restoring and replacing components, and testing individual parts and the whole product to ensure it meets its original design and performance specifications, as seen from the customer’s perspective.                                                                           | BS 8887-2:2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Repair                                   | Repair is the process of returning a faulty or broken product or component to a usable state. The effort put into the repair is minimal and only addresses the specified fault to ensure the useability of the product; however, the performance of the repaired part may not be guaranteed. The warranty for a repaired product is generally less than that of a new or remanufactured product and may only apply to the replaced or repaired component                                                                                                       | BS 8887-2:2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

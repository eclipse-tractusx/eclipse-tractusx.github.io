### Business Architecture

#### Introduction

PURIS enables exchange of data with suppliers and customers via standardized interfaces (see Digital Twin KIT, Industry Core KIT). The PURIS KIT delivers:

- Operative capabilities to exchange information with direct upstream / downstream supply chain partners in a strict 1-up / 1-down manner.
- Data models that MUST be applied for the interoperable data exchange
- Process help on how to provision data correctly, especially in regard to multi-sourcing and multi-customer scenarios.
- Ideas on value-adding usage of these concepts (see use case example above).

To allow all partners to benefit in the best way from PURIS, each involved party needs to provide their data on the basis of the latest information from the shop floor and its internal systems.

#### Components

From conceptual point of view a PURIS system consists of different building blocks. These building blocks in the following diagram show which participant deploys which components. Identification and Access Management is omitted for simplicity reasons.

![PURIS KIT Architecture](resources/purisKitArchitecture.png)

The PURIS App is a software application that allows to exchange relevant data with partners. It's meant to

- Provide data following the shared asset approach (see Digital Twin KIT). It manages the Digital Twin Registry (AAS Registry and AAS Discovery API) and provides the data in the correct format via Submodel API.
- Manage the apis and assets in the Connector (see Connector KIT).

The following components are needed for the communication based on the PURIS standard:

- PURIS App = Component orchestrating the Data Exchange following this KIT (as explained above) while providing business value.
- Connector = Component that manages data and API as assets to enable the sovereign data exchange (see Connector KIT)
- Digital Twin Registry = Component that provides AAS Registry and AAS Discovery API implementations (see Digital Twin KIT)
- Data Provisioning & Transformation = Proprietary component allowing to use OWN data or to use PURIS data in internal systems.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) = Identity Provider spanning authentication and authorization within Catena-X and / or your company. Includes the Credential Service to proof e.g. that a participant signed the Framework Agreement.

## Logic & Schema

PURIS enables data exchange between partners (one-up/one-down) within Catena-X using the Connector, focusing on a short-term horizon, such as 4 weeks, without imposing a strict time limit.

- PURIS allows organizations to exchange material flow-related data with contractual partners (one-up, one-down)
- PURIS respects the data sovereignty of each participant with regard to its own data or data owner

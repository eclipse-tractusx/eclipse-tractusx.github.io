You can participate in the Catena-X data ecosystem in various roles. Become acquainted with the foundational building blocks of Catena-X and how all participants collaborate within a global ecosystem by reading the [Whitepaper describing the Catena-X operating model](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/_online_media_/CX_Operating_Modelv2.1_final.pdf).

Actors willing to use the Catena-X DCM standard, and start a collaboration with other supply chain partners enabled by an interoperable solution, can prepare asking the IT colleagues to check the following [End-to-End Adopter Journey](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/tutorials/e2e/).

## Roles

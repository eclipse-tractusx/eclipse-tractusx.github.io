It is structured according to the following categories:

- General Information
- Product Condition
- Composition
- Cell Chemistry
- Electrochemical Properties
- Additional Information
  In addition, the Battery Pass data model offers the following advantages:
- It is self-describing, which means it has all the details necessary to comprehend what it includes. Different systems can easily interpret the Battery Pass as a result.
- It is extendable, therefore new information can be added without much difficulty. As a result, the Battery Pass will be able to adapt to the changing requirements of the battery sector.
- It establishes a common semantic in Catena-X which other passes can build upon.

### Transmission Pass

#### Transmission Pass Introduction

In addition to the Battery Pass, numerous other components will require digital product passports. One example is the vehicle transmission, for which a standardized passport already exists. The Transmission Passport serves as tool for advancing a sustainable and circular transmission value chain.
To enable stakeholders to access relevant data, the passport leverages Catena-X shared services, a standardized data model, and an application. The initial version of the Transmission Passport model includes the following information:

- Transmission Identification
- General Information
- Sustainability Information
- State of Health Information
- Product Specific Parameters
- Instructions
- Track and Trace Data

By incorporating circularity parameters, the Transmission Passport aims to enhance transparency and promote a circular economy within the European Union. Detailed descriptions can be found in the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation Proposal (ESPR). This proposal identifies content clusters for circularity and establishes concrete circularity parameters for the Transmission Passport. The data sets encompass information relevant to both closed and open loop business models.
It is important to note that the data model includes optional and mandatory information fields to fulfill regulatory requirements. Sharing information within the network relies on decentralized technologies and is always subject to individual decisions by each provider. The data model aligns with the newly proposed Ecodesign Regulation (ESPR-2022) and will be continuously adapted to changing circumstances. As one of the first extensions of the EcoPass KIT, more product passes are expected soon to serve the demand of data models across the automotive industry.

## Business Architecture

The Business Architecture illustrates the interaction between the EcoPass KIT and other KITs, components, data models, and artifacts used for identity and access management, illustrated by the Figure below.

![Image: Business Architecture](/docs/resources/adoption-view/adoption-view-EcoPassKITBusinessArch.png)

The core of the network is to provide interoperability between different applications. For this reason, a common semantic is indispensable. In the Catena-X ecosystem, it has been agreed to use the description language SAMM to describe data models.
To additionally provide a standardized interface, the open standard of the International Digital Twin Association (IDTA) is used, abbreviated as IDTA. This standard corresponds to the Asset Administration Shell (AAS).
It is used to discover digital twins and exchange actual usage data.
To control access to both usage and meta data, the EcoPass KIT relies on the [Connector KIT](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/tractusx-edc/docs/kit/adoption-view/Adoption%20View/). Interactions between two parties occur exclusively peer-to-peer via the standardized interfaces of the Connector KIT, based on the International Data Space Protocol.
Data sovereignty is enabled by so-called verifiable credentials. These rely on the technology of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and are enabled through the Connector KIT. In short, consumers must present their signed credentials, defined by a data provider, before a data contract (and thus a data exchange) can take place. It should be mentioned that this concept is still in the prototype phase as of Release 3.2 and will be expanded in future releases.

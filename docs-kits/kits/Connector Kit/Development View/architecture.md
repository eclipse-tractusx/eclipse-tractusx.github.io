# Architecture

## Overview

The following diagram shows an example architecture including the Connector Kit. In this case the EDC is used as a sample implementation of the Connector Kit.

## Interactions

The Connector interacts with the following other components:

### Database

The Connector requires a database for persistence. In the reference implementation, a database instance for each Connector is required.
This database does not store any of the actual asset data, but rather the metadata consisting of Contracts, Negotiations or Policies.
In the reference implementation, this metadata is generated by the management plane.

### Secret Vault

Secrets in use by the connector need to be stored securely.
This is usually accomplished via a secret vault such as Hashicorp Vault or Azure Vault. 

### Business Applications

The reason to use a Connector in the first place is to make data available to or obtain it from other participants.
This data comes from or is used in your other Business Applications.
These interact with the Connector by providing addresses where said data can be found that are then wrapped in Assets by the Connector.

### Other Connectors

The interactions between different Connectors are a large part of the functionality of said Connectors.
The specifics of these interactions and how to manage them are described in great detail in the 
[Management API Walkthrough](./Management-API%20Walkthrough/1-management-api-overview.md).

### Catena X Portal

Contact with the Catena X Portal is necessary to register as a participant and obtain a Business Partner Number. This ID is used in exchanges with other participants.

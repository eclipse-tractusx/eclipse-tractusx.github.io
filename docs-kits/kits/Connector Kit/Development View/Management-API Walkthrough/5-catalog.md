# Fetching a provider's Catalog

The catalog API is the first request in this sequence that passes through the Dataspace. It is executed by the Data 
Consumer against their own Control Plane and triggers the retrieval of a catalog from a specified Data Provider. The request
looks like this:

```http
POST /v2/catalog/request HTTP/1.1
Host: https://consumer-control.plane/api/management
X-Api-Key: password
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/"
  },
  "@type": "edc:CatalogRequest",
  "counterPartyAddress": "https://provider-control.plane/api/v1/dsp",
  "protocol": "dataspace-protocol-http",
  "querySpec": {
    "@type": "edc:QuerySpec",
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 50,
    "sortField": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/type",
    "sortOrder": "ASC",
    "filterExpression": [
      {
        "@context": {
          "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
        },
        "@type": "edc:Criterion",
        "operandLeft": "edc:someProperty",
        "operator": "=",
        "operandRight": "value"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
The request body is lean. Mandatory properties are:
- `counterPartyAddress` (formerly `providerUrl`): This property points to the DSP-endpoint of the Data Provider's Control
Plane. Usually this ends on `/api/v1/dsp`.
- `protocol`: must be `"dataspace-protocol-http"`.

The `querySpec` section is optional and allows the Data Consumer to specify what entries from the catalog shall be returned.
How to write proper `filterExpression`s was previously [explained](4-contract-definitions.md#assetsselector).

## What happens in the background

In this walkthrough's sequence of API-calls, this is the first that triggers interaction between two EDCs. The Consumer
requests the Provider's catalog of Data Offers. Partners in the Dataspace are authenticated via Verifiable Credentials (VC).
These can broadly be conceptualized as another JSON-LD document that holds information on a business partner's identity.
It follows an aligned schema and is extensible with properties relevant to the Dataspace. For more info, see
[the documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-docu/blob/main/docs/credentials/summary/summary.vc.md) 
of the currently used Summary Credential used in Catena-X.

When the Consumer makes a catalog-request to the Provider, the provider collects the Consumer's VC and checks it against
each of the `accessPolicies` defined in his [Contract Definitions](4-contract-definitions.md). If the VC passes the 
`accessPolicy`, the Contract Definition is transformed to a Data Offer and added to the catalog. If the content of the VC
does not fulfil the `accessPolicy`, the Contract Definition is invisible for the requesting Data Consumer - rendering
any further communication between the Business Partners useless.

## Returned Payload

The returned payload is a `dcat:Catalog` as required by the [DSP-Specification v0.8](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/dataspace-protocol/catalog/catalog.protocol).

```
In the payload above, some properties are meta-data that's independent of whether the Provider extends any Data Offers
to the Consumer. 

- The `@id` is the identifier for this catalog. As the catalog is created dynamically, the id is a UUID regenerated for each
  request to the Provider's catalog.
- `dcat:service` holds data about the Provider's connector that the Consumer's connector communicated with.
- `edc:participantId` signifies the BPN of the Provider. This is specific to the EDC and not mandated by the DSP-spec.
- `@context` is part of every JSON-LD document.

The Data Offers are hidden in the `dcat:dataset` section, grouped by the [Asset](2-assets.md) that the offer is made for.
Consequently, if there may be more than one offer for the same Asset, requiring a Data Consumer to select based on the 
policies included.

- The `@id` corresponds to the id of the Asset that can be negotiated for.
- `dcat:Distribution` makes statements over which Data Planes an Asset's data can be retrieved. Currently, the EDC always
returns `HttpProxy` and `AmazonS3` even though not all EDC-deployments have both capabilities.
- `dcat:hasPolicy` holds the Data Offer that is relevant for the Consumer.
  - `@id` is the identifier for the Data Offer. The EDC composes this id by concatenating three identifiers in base64-encoding.
  separated with `:` (colons). The format is `base64(contractDefinitionId):base64(assetId):base64(newUuidV4)`. The last 
  of three UUIDs changes with every request as every /v2/catalog/request call yields a new catalog with new Data Offers.
  - The `odrl:target` properties in the Data Offer always hold the Asset's id.
  - The `odrl:permission`, `odrl:prohibition` and `odrl:obligation` will hold the content of the contractPolicy configured
  in the [Contract Definition](4-contract-definitions.md) the Contract Offer was derived from.

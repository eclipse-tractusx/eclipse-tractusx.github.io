The Policies are used to increase data sovereignty by limiting the access and usage of data. In the following, access
and usage policies with their usage in the EDC are described. An explanation of Policy-handling mechanics in the EDC
is available in the [EDC docs](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/blob/main/docs/usage/management-api-walkthrough/02_policies.md#access--usage-policies).
For general conventions about Usage Policies in Catena-X, check the [Connector Kit](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/connector-kit).

### Usage Policies / Contract Policies

Policies are defined based on the [W3C ODRL format](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/). This allows a standardized way
of formulating policy payloads. To further define and restrict the possibilities of the ODRL language, it is recommended
to create separate, more specific ODRL profiles. For Catena-X, the profile is published [here](https://github.com/catenax-eV/cx-odrl-profile).

#### FrameworkAgreement

As described in the Connector Kit, there is a Credential issued for each Use Case Framework. As the Industry Core (IC)
is not a use-case but rather a set of foundational models and technologies, there is no specific Framework Agreement for
it.

#### UsagePurpose

Instead, there's a set of purposes for the Industry Core. These purposes can be used in all use-cases that build on it,
and for instance be chained with the FrameworkAgreementConstraint for the Traceability use-case.
The complete list is formalized in the CX-ODRL-Profile. Here's an example constraint for the IC's foundational purpose:

```
{
    "@context": [
             "https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
             {
                 "cx-policy": "https://w3id.org/catenax/policy/"
             }
         ],
    "leftOperand": "cx-policy:UsagePurpose",
    "operator": "eq",
    "rightOperand": "cx.core.industrycore:1"
}
```

As the IC in turn relies on a set of other components and concepts. The `cx.core.industrycore:1` purpose however should
only be used on offers leading to aspects, usually behind a Submodel API. Despite the fact that the Digital Twin
Registry (as defined in the [DT Kit](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/next/category/digital-twin-kit/) is
a mandatory component of the Industry Core, it should be exposed only with the purpose `cx.core.digitalTwinRegistry:1`.

Policies are used to increase data sovereignty by limiting the access and usage of data. In the following, access and usage policies with their usage in the EDC are described.

### Access Policies

#### BPN Access Policy

This policy allows limiting access to a data offer based on a list of specific BPNs. This translates to the following functionality:

- The data offer creator will be able to create a policy listing all the BPN that can access the data offer
- This means that only the connectors registered in the Catena-X network with the BPN listed in the policy can see the data offer and accept it (for the creation of data contracts and subsequent data exchange)
<!-- - To fulfill the requirements of the **Supply Chain Act**, a NGO Trustee is introduced that is trusted by the complete supply chain to evaluate if an inquiring company is impacted by a specific ESS incident.
Every Trustee is represented in the Catena-X network as a general participant with a unique BPN. Further, the Trustee is allowed to use supplier relationships and BoM data beyond the one-up/one-down principle due to the legal regulations.
In order to grant access to the BoM as planned data assets, the Trustee's BPN must be mentioned in the policy. -->

Examples including a JSON payload for single and multiple BPN are described on [this page in the tractus-x EDC repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/tree/c8e9675faf417ec5cded9537964da834d49c52cb/edc-extensions/bpn-validation) or in the [Connector Kit](../../../category/connector-kit).

### Usage Policies / Contract Policies

Policies are defined based on the [W3C ODRL format](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/). This allows a standardized way of formulating policy payloads. It further allows to stack different constraints with the `odrl:and` operator. Therefore, every data provider can decide on his or her own under which conditions their data assets are shared in the network.

Since usage or contract policies are highly dependent on the use case, they are described by them in their associated KITs.

### Contract Definitions

In the EDC, every policy is connected with a data asset by a contract definition. Details about the endpoint and payload can be found in the [Transfer Data sample in the tractus-x EDC repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc/blob/bc7a1aaf8e1d2a742f71c04e98bcdf409a274fc3/docs/samples/Transfer%20Data.md#2-setup-data-offer).

### Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable Credentials (VC) are part of the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standard by the W3C. Details about Catena-X specific VCs can be found in the [CX - 0016 Company Attribute Verification](#standards) standard. As mentioned there, it offers a `UseCaseFrameworkConditionCX` type allowing a data provider to check if specific conditions, like a signed use case contract as introduced in the [Purpose-base Usage Policy section](#purpose-based-policy), are agreed. Further technical documentation are presented in the [SSI Docu](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-docu/tree/main/docs/architecture) repository.

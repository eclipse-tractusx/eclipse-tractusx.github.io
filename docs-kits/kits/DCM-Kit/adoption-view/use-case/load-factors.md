Participant c as Customer
Participant s as Supplier
rect rgb(157,93,00) 
c->>s: I need 100 red and 100 chrome toys
end
s->>s: Chrome toys strain my capacities twice as much as red toys
rect rgb(64,74,00)
s-->>c: Your demand and my capacities need to be expressed as production cycles.
s-->>c: Red toys are loaded with factor 1
s-->>c: Chrome toys are loaded with factor 2
s->>c: My overall capacity is 250 cycles
end
c->>c: My demands are 100 red cycles plus 200 chrome cycles equals 300 cycles
c->>c: Their capacity for both toys is 250 cycles
```

## Audience & Scope

This guideline is relevant for companies acting as:

1. a data provider or data consumer that want to enable your custom software for Catena-X DCM
2. a Business Application Provider and want to enable your commercial software for Catena-X DCM

## Pre-requisites

You can participate in the Catena-X data ecosystem in various roles. Become acquainted with the foundational building blocks of Catena-X and how all participants collaborate within a global ecosystem by reading the [Whitepaper describing the Catena-X operating model](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/_online_media_/CX_Operating_Modelv2.1_final.pdf).

Actors willing to use the Catena-X DCM standard, and start a collaboration with other supply chain partners enabled by an interoperable solution, can prepare asking the IT colleagues to check the following [End-to-End Adopter Journey](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/tutorials/e2e/).

## Onboarding steps for Data Providers / Data Consumers

Data providers or data consumers that want to enable your custom software for Catena-X DCM need to:

1. register for the Catena-X Ecosystem
2. be technically onboarded in the Catena-X Network and take care of an organizational onboarding within your Company
3. setup the necessary IT parts for the go-live
4. receive a Business Partner Number (BPN)
5. accept the DCM Framework Agreement/Use Case Policy
6. sign necessary contract(s), e.g. the Data Exchange Contract(s) with your partner(s)

Additional information:

- For the steps 1 to 4 please refer to the documentation on the [Catena-X website](https://catena-x.net/en/participate), choosing the approach that best fits your role. After these steps, you will be able to see which other companies have been onboarded and are technically able to connect with you for the DCM use case
- For step 5, please accept the [Use Case Policy published on the Catena-X website](https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/governance-framework-for-data-space-operations). In addition, please refer to the document [CX-0050-FrameworkAgreementCredential](https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/user_upload/Standard-Bibliothek/Update_September23/CX-0050-FrameworkAgreementCredential-v.1.0.0.pdf) chapter 2.4.5
- For step 6, please check with your DCM counterparts, if it is required to sign a separate document or if this has already been covered within the contract between you and your partners

## Adoption Strategies for Data Providers / Data Consumers

A company interested in operating the Catena-X DCM standard can decide to go for one of the following **implementation strategies**:

Strategy 1

- purchase a Catena-X DCM certified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution
  - adopting a certified solution ensures that it has been developed and conformed to the DCM standard, as these have been approved by the Catena-X Association
- in this case, the next step is to purchase a commercial solution
  - to do so, access the marketplace of an operating company (e.g. Cofinity-X), and choose the solution that best fits you
  - alternatively, get in touch with commercial vendors directly

Strategy 2

- adopt and deploy an existing Free and Open Source Solution (FOSS)
  - adopting a certified solution ensures that it has been developed and conformed to the DCM standard, as these have been approved by the Catena-X Association

Strategy 3

- adopt and integrate the business logic, API and data models according to the Catena-X DCM standard into an existing software solution (e.g. self-developed software)
  - here you then need to make sure that the application developed is conform to the DCM standard.
- in this case, refer to the document DCM [Architecture View](page_architecture-view.md) for further technical details related to your next steps

Please refer to the [Catena-X Library](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library) for the newest version of the  DCM as well as other standards.

## Step overview

1. Join the [Catena-X network](https://catena-x.net/en/catena-x-introduce-implement/onboarding)
2. Follow the onboarding process
3. Get a DCM App. There are now three different options:
    1. Buy a certified commercial DCM App. See the Catena-X market place for offers.
    2. Use a open source solution for DCM.
    3. Modify or develop your own software to work with Catena-X. See DCM [Architecture View](page_architecture-view.md) for details.
4. Start exchanging data with your partner companies

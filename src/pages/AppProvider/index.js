                The Tractus-X project is structured along the 4 domains that represent use cases in Catena-X:<br/>
                First, there is the Network & Core Services domain, which forms the basis for the  functionality of the  business domains. It is the foundation to build on and is mainly provided by the operator.
              </p>
              <p className="description-p">
                Then we have the business domains:<br/>
                PLM & Quality, Resiliency and Sustainability, each dealing with  specific industry challenges, that Catena-X solves with the help of KITs. Each of the domains provide at least one specific KIT with a clearly defined toolbox of development artifacts that support data providers to join a use case.

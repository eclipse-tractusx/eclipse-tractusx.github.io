# Community

<b>We warmly welcome You to shape the automotive value chain of the next generation!</b>

The global Tractus-X community consists of a broad range of users, contributors, and committers from various companies (and individual actors) in the automotive value chain. We sincerely invite anyone to participate who wants to shape our architecture, reference implementations KITs for our Catena-X data space.

## Communication Rules

A pre-requisite for joining the Tractus-X communication channels is an Eclipse Foundation Account: https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register?destination=user

In addition, we encourage you to sign the Eclipse Contribution Agreement (ECA) to contribute to our Tractus-X project. For example, report and fix bugs or implement enhancements according to the Tractus-X roadmap. https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/how-to-contribute

- **For a first contact** please use our Tractus-X mailing list to get in touch with our community or a specific product team you want to contribute. tractusx-dev@eclipse.org

- **For quick and informal syncs** please use our Matrix Chat to align on easy topics, ask questions, share a link or a bite-size piece of information. https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#tools.tractus-x:matrix.eclipse.org

- **For product alignments** please set up a meeting with a tool of your choice as a project manager. The preparation of meeting minutes is not required. Recurring formal meetings must be communicated via our Tractus-X mailing list.
Ad hoc informal meetings may be organized without prior notice.

- **For cross-product alignments** the Catena-X Association is currently preparing various committees to support the coordination of the open-source products and repositories. The goal of a committee is to discuss, define and create a common vision, roadmap, standards, architecture, KITs, etc.

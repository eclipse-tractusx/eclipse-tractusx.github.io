# Release Information

[Catena-X Standards](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library) are the foundation for certifying any software product operating in the Catena-X data space. Those standards are the binding reference to obtain a valid certificate. To make adopting the latest Catena-X standards easier, reference implementations are provided through the Eclipse Tractus-X Project. Those Releases are published in a periodic cadence.

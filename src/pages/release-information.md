# Release Information

[Catena-X Standards](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library) are the foundation for certifying any software product operating in the Catena-X data space. These standards are the
binding reference to obtain a valid certificate. To facilitate the adoption of the latest Catena-X standards, the Eclipse Tractus-X Project provides reference implementations, released
on a quarterly basis.

## Quarterly Release Cycle

Eclipse Tractus-X follows a structured release cycle, delivering four releases annually. Each release encompasses several key milestones:

- **Refinement Phase:** Initial discussions to outline and prioritize features for the upcoming release.
- **Refinement Day 1:** Collaborative sessions to refine feature requirements and identify dependencies.
- **Refinement Day 2:** Continued refinement, focusing on resolving dependencies and finalizing feature scopes.
- **DRAFT Feature Freeze:** A preliminary cutoff point where feature definitions are solidified, allowing for adjustments before finalization.
- **Release Planning Days:** Finalization of the release plan, confirming feature inclusion and setting development timelines.

:::tip
For detailed timelines and specific dates of these milestones, refer to the [sig-release milestones](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/milestones) and the timeline on the
[Release Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/26/views/35)

## Feature Submission Process

To propose new features for inclusion in an upcoming release, contributors must utilize the [Feature Template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=1_feature_template.md).
This template ensures consistent and comprehensive feature proposals. The `sig-release` repository serves as the management hub for new features in the next release.

:::note
All other tasks and issues should be created in their respective repositories where the actual work is conducted. These issues must be linked within the feature proposal to maintain traceability and coherence.

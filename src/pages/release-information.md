# Release Information

## Introduction

[Catena-X Standards](https://catena-x.net/de/standard-library) are the foundation for certifying any software component operating in the Catena-X data space. Those standards are the binding reference to obtain a valid certificate.

To make adopting the latest Catena-X standards easier, reference implementations are provided through the Elipse Tractus-X Project. Releases of these reference implementations happen four times a year using a [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) scheme, and include the operating system consisting of core services, enablement services, and KITs.

Please check the [Change Log](/CHANGELOG) for content, known knowns, and backward compatibility since the calendar versioning scheme readily shows the year and month of release.

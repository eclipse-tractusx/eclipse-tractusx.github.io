                A data provider / consumer (DPC) provides, consumes, and processes data to collaborate with other data  space participants to solve a specific industry problem and create business value.  This includes both standardized use cases and direct collaboration.
              </p>
              <p className="description-p">
                First, a data provider needs to decide  which use case(s)they want to participate in: You want to exchange CO2 values? Use the PCF KIT. You want to exchange part data? Use the Traceability KIT. For each Catena-X use case there is a KIT available to ensure that the integration is described.
              </p>
              <p className="description-p">
                Next, a data provider needs the general technical requirements for data exchange, to be able to share data in the ecosystem. There is an  end-to-end journey documentation available.

                The Tractus-X project is structured along the 4 domains that represent use cases in Catena-X:<br/>
                First, there is the Network & Core Services domain, which forms  the basis for the functionality of the business domains. It's the foundation to build on and is mainly provided by the operator.
              </p>
              <p className="description-p">
                Then we have the business domains:<br/>
                PLM & Quality, Resiliency and Sustainability, each addressing a specific set of industry challenges that Catena-X solves with the help of KITs.
              </p>
              <p className="description-p">
                Each of the domains provide at least one KIT with a well-defined toolbox of business and development artifacts that support data providers to join a use case. They can use the KITs to connect their existing in-house infrastructure to the Catena-X data space by mapping to the semantic data models and interfaces.

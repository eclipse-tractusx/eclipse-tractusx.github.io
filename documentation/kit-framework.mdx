In this documentation you will find a comprehensive overview of the KIT framework, including its architecture, content structure, and the various artifacts that make up a KIT. Whether you are a developer looking to implement a KIT, an operator seeking deployment guidance, or a business stakeholder interested in understanding the value proposition of a KIT, this documentation provides the necessary insights and resources to get started.

## What is a KIT?

**KIT**, short for **Keep It Together**, is an open-source toolbox with comprehensive documentation that enables multiple stakeholders **(Business, Solution Providers, Developers)** to build interoperable applications compatible with the Eclipse Tractus-X dataspace technologies, and support the compliance with industrial standards from standarization organizations (Catena-X e.V., IDTA, ISO/DIN, EDWG, Manufacturing-X, etc.) and in some cases enable regulatory compliance.

A KIT provides everything needed to implement and deploy specific business scenarios within a dataspace environment - from architectural guidance and API specifications to reference implementations and operational procedures. Each KIT serves as a complete, self-contained package that enables developers, operators, and business stakeholders to understand, build, and run solutions that are interoperable across the dataspace network.

The KIT framework, allows different stakeholders to easily find relevant information and resources tailored to their specific needs, whether they are looking for high-level overviews, technical details, or operational guidelines.

By following the KIT structure, organizations can ensure that their solutions align with the broader goals of Eclipse Tractus-X, promoting:

## KIT Evolution: 1.0 to 2.0

The KIT framework has evolved significantly to support the growing needs of multiple dataspaces and industries:

<KitVersionComparison />

The transition from KIT 1.0 to KIT 2.0 represents a fundamental shift in how we approach dataspace interoperability. While KIT 1.0 served the Catena-X automotive dataspace well, KIT 2.0 embraces a broader vision - enabling multiple industries to leverage the same foundational technologies while maintaining the flexibility to address industry-specific requirements through modular extensions.

This evolution ensures that core dataspace capabilities remain consistent and interoperable, while allowing each industry to build specialized solutions on top of a shared foundation.

### Changelog

To achieve uniformity, we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Concrete examples in our already published [KITs](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/Kits).
For a KIT we distinguish between three phases sandbox, incubating and graduated.

### Adoption View

The adoption view gives a general introduction to the KIT. It aims to provide insights to industry problems, the KIT is addressing.
Mandatory for every KIT and all graduation stages
The vision describes the strategic objectives of a KIT and how it aims to inspire solution providers.
Deliverables:

- Vision catch phrase + context
- Mission catch phrase
- Context to the use case
Starting with the **vision of the KIT** (one or two catching phrases)
`Example from BPDM:`
Unique business partner data sets for the whole data space. Basis for integration value-adding services in the area of business partner data management.

#### The missions of the KIT

Mandatory for every KIT and all graduation stages
The mission explains why we are providing the KIT describing a concrete industry problem.
`Example from BPDM:` "The KIT provides a homogenous semantic with an open data model, high data quality and one access point to the business partner data sets."

##### Giving more context with explaining the connection to the use case

`Example from BPDM:`
The BusinessPartner KIT provides high-quality data records of business partners called golden record, including a unique identifier, the business partner number (BPN).
…

#### Business Value

Mandatory for every KIT that is related to a use case and all graduation stages
The business value describes the benefits for an service provider by using a KIT in order to create a commercial or non-profit solution for the Catena-X marketplaces.
Deliverable:
About 3 to 5 top business values (title + description)
`Example from BPDM:`
One open data model: Application and Service provider can reduce investments to integrate due to one data model / API specification and open interface. The pool API enables the integration and offering of value-added services and innovation based on high-quality master data.
Access to new market potentials: Potential to scale customer group and access new market potentials via Catena-X marketplace and shared service network. The BP KIT enables an interoperable foundation for value-added services.
The unique identifier: BPN is the unique number to identify and find partners in the Catena-X network. It will also provide high quality data sets from business partners, their legal unit, sites and addresses.

#### Use Case / Domain explanation

Mandatory for every KIT that is related to a use case and all graduation stages
This gives more insights into the use case or domain itself.

- Todays challenge
- Values for taking the challenge
- Benefits for OEM, SME, Solution Provider
Deliverable: Status quo, challenge and the benefits from different perspectives
`Example from BPDM:`
Business Partner KIT comes from the use case Business Partner Data Management.
Status Quo / Todays challenge:
Most of today’s automotive companies have to invest a significant amount to keep their individual partner master data updated and correct, since outdated or incorrect data records result in federal fines and wrong claims / billing processes. The industry spends a vast amount into an area that is non differentiating, regulated and executed redundantly across the partners.
For this, cutting individual company costs by offering the golden master data record as a shared service and proactively reduce Business Partner risk via collaborative value-add services.
This will become the industry’s largest golden record collection as a shared and cost-optimized service (quality tested by the biggest players).
OEMs and small-medium enterprises can:
- Reduce today’s individual investments in master data mgt.
- Re-allocate freed-up resources to differentiating / critical tasks
- Time to value within 6 months, due to standard interfaces and mapping tools (e.g. SAP)
- Increase data quality and use industry collective wisdom to act pro-actively (e.g. fraud alerts)
Solution Provider:
- Reduce investments to integrate due to one Data Model and open interface.
- The KIT enables the offering of value-add services and innovation based on golden record and collective wisdom.
- Potential to scale customer group and access new market potentials via marketplace and shared service network.

#### Tutorials

Mandatory for the 'Graduated' stage. Optional for 'sandbox' and 'incubating'
A tutorial provides educational resources that provides step-by-step guidance on how to use a KIT. Tutorials can be delivered in various formats, such as videos or written text. It may also provide additional resources for further exploration of the topic.
Deliverables:

- Description
- Tutorial video or screenshot documentation

#### Whitepaper

Optional
A whitepaper outlines the overall objectives of a KIT regarding a specific business problem. It provides readers with background information on the topic, identifies key challenges and solutions to those challenges, evaluates alternative approaches to solving the business problem at hand, and offers recommendations for action.
Deliverable:

- Description
- Link to the whitepaper

#### Standards

Optional but highly recommended
Standards are essential for ensuring interoperability and consistency across different implementations of a KIT. By adhering to established standards, KITs can facilitate seamless integration and communication between various systems and stakeholders within the ecosystem.

- A table of non-dataspace specific standards relevant for the KIT

Example: 

| Standard | Version | Reference |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Standard Name** | 1.0     | [Link to Standard](https://example.com) |

:::warning
If there is an industry specific standard, please include it on the Industry Extensions Tab for your industry.
:::

#### Semantic Models

Mandatory for every KIT that is related to a use case + for the 'incubating' stage
The semantic data models are a method of structuring data that includes semantic information that adds a basic meaning to the data and the relationships that lie between them to enable interoperability.
Deliverables:

- Description
- Link to the semantic data models (GitHub)
`Example from Traceability:`
[Traceability Semantic Models](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs-kits/kits/traceability-kit/adoption-view#semantic-models)

:::warning
If there is an industry specific semantic model, please include it on the Industry Extensions Tab for your industry.
:::

#### Logic / Schema

Mandatory for every KIT that is related to a use case + for the 'incubating' stage
Logic / schemas provides a definition of the minimum viable business process that must be implemented to enable interoperability.
Deliverables: Description

#### Business Process

Mandatory for every KIT that is related to a use case + for the 'incubating' stage
Data sovereignty is one of the main principles of Eclipse Tractus-X and a major topic for the participants in the data space. This part should help to understand how the business process works and provides a blue print on how access & usage policies **could** look like.

- Business Architecture
- Access & Usage Policies


### Development View

The development view provides developers with resources to accelerate the development of apps and services.

#### Architecture Overview

The architecture view is an optional chapter. It offers an architecture perspective including the main building blocks and the runtime view. It can be extended with more architecture documentation like an ARC42.

- In the category documentation you can include links like this:

```js

{
    type: 'category',
    label: 'Documentation',
    items: [
        // Add your links here:
        {
            type: 'link',
            label: 'Your Link Label',  // Change this to your link text
            href: 'https://example.com/your-url'  // Change this to your URL
        }
    ]
}
```

You can update that in ['/sidebarsDocsKits.js'](../sidebarsDocsKits.js) file at the root folder.


### Industry Extensions

The Industry Extensions view represents a specialized extension mechanism that allows KITs to be adapted and customized for specific industry implementations while maintaining their core structure and functionality. This approach ensures interoperability across different industries while allowing for industry-specific requirements, policies, and standards.

#### Folder Structure

The industry extensions are organized in a clear folder structure within each KIT:

```
docs-kits/kits/your-kit/
├── adoption-view/
├── development-view/
├── operations-view/
├── documentation/
└── industry-extensions/
    ├── automotive/
    │   ├── standards.md
    │   ├── policies.md
    │   └── semantic-models.md
    ├── shop-floor/
    │   ├── standards.md
    │   └── policies.md
    └── semiconductor/
        └── standards.md
```

Each industry folder contains only the specific extensions relevant to that industry, allowing for flexible and modular customization.

#### Purpose and Scope

Industry Extensions enable KITs to support multiple industry verticals (such as Automotive, Shop Floor, Semiconductor, etc.) without duplicating the core KIT content. Each industry extension contains:

- **Industry-specific policies** that govern data usage and access within that particular industry
- **Custom semantic models** tailored to the specific industry or domain requirements
- **Industry standards** that may differ from generic implementations
- **Compliance requirements** specific to regulatory or industry standards

#### Standards

Mandatory for every KIT that wants to go to the 'incubating' stage
Links to the relevant standards (Association Library). Add the relevant number of the standard, the name and version of the standard.
The industry specific standards should be added in this section and are hosted in the industry's standard library. 
Normally it includes a table and a header similiar to this ones in the example.

Example:

##### Automotive Industry Standards

| ID | Name | Link |
| -- | ---- | ---- |
| CX-0002 | Digital Twins in Catena-X v2.2.0 | [go to standard](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/next/standards/CX-0002-DigitalTwinsInCatenaX) |


#### Structure and Implementation

The following diagram illustrates how generic KIT components relate to industry-specific extensions:

            SEMI_STD["  STANDARDS  "]
        end
    end
    
    Generic --> IE
    
```

This modular approach enables KITs to serve as universal building blocks that can be specialized for different industry verticals while maintaining their core value proposition and functionality.

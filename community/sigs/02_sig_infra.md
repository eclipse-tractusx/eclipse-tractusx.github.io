## Intro

SIG infra is striving to improve the developer experience in Eclipse Tractus-X, by working on different automation topics.
We are also providing guidance on how to work with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and support the [e2e-testing](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/e2e-testing)
approach, that will be based on a umbrella Chart and Helm tests.

## Dash automation

A topic, every Tractus-X repo has to take care of, is legal compliance.
One of the aspects is an up-to-date `DEPENDENCIES` file, generated by [eclipse dash-licenses](https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses).
SIG infra is maintaining a [run-dash](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra/tree/main/.github/actions/run-dash)
GitHub action, that helps to ensure the `DEPENDENCIES` file stays up-to-date.

- Document the architecture and the relationships between the products
- Document the design decisions of the project itself, regarding other dataspaces and organizations
- Enable a fluid and synchronized integration of the Eclipse Tractus-X dataspace, having a big picture how it comes together.
- Easy the understanding for external technical viewers who want to learn how Eclipse Tractus-X has been built from architectural point of view.
- Document dataspace usage patterns to increase performance, reduce complexity and ease the adoption of the dataspace.

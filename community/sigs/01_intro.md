title: "What is a SIG?"
---

Eclipse Tractus-X consists of different applications, products, KITs and also hosts other supporting repositories.
All of these repositories have a very dedicated goal and focus.
However, there are of course cross-cutting topics, that affect our whole project.

To foster these needs, we decided to form "Special Interest Groups", or "SIGs" in short.

## Tractus-X Community

We warmly welcome You to shape the automotive value chain of the next generation!
The global Tractus-X community consists of a broad range of users, contributors, and committers from various companies
(and individual actors) in the automotive value chain. We sincerely invite anyone to participate who wants to shape our
architecture, reference implementations KITs for our Catena-X data space.

## Communication Rules

A pre-requisite for joining the Tractus-X communication channels is
an [Eclipse Foundation Account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register?destination=user).

In addition, we encourage you to sign the Eclipse Contribution Agreement (ECA) to contribute to our Tractus-X project.
For example, report and fix bugs or implement enhancements according to the Tractus-X roadmap. See
our [contributing guide](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/how-to-contribute).

- __For a first contact__ please use our Tractus-X mailing list (tractusx-dev@eclipse.org) to get in touch with our
  community or a specific product team you want to contribute.
- __For quick and informal syncs__ please use
  our [Eclipse Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#automotive.tractusx:matrix.eclipse.org) to align on easy topics, ask
  questions, share a link or a bite-size piece of information.
- __For product alignments__ please set up a meeting with a tool of your choice as a project manager. The preparation of
  meeting minutes is not required. Recurring formal meetings must be communicated via our Tractus-X mailing list. Ad hoc
  informal meetings may be organized without prior notice.
- __For cross-product alignments__ the Catena-X Association is currently preparing various committees to support the
  coordination of the open-source products and repositories. The goal of a committee is to discuss, define and create a
  common vision, roadmap, standards, architecture, KITs, etc.

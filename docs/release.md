# Release Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to Tractus-X Release Guidelines, known as TRGs. TRG numbers are assigned by the TRG
editors, and once assigned never changed. The version control history of the TRG texts represent their historical
record. The TRGs are indexed by topic for specialist subjects.

You find the overarching Changelog [here](trg-0/trg-0) to see when new TRGs have been added.

## Process

This TRG process is open for all and has the main goal of providing reasonable defaults for workflows and requirements on being able to easily contribute, maintain and run products/components across Eclipse Tractus-X.

- Create a draft version under release/trg-0
- Create a pull request for merging the draft version (IF it helps to visualize / present the draft on the website) and get an approval
- Create new Pull Request for moving the draft version to its final location
- Communicate the PR on the mailing list
- Address all issues in the PR discussion
- Merge the new TRG with a defined 'active on date'
- Announce new TRG on the mailing list

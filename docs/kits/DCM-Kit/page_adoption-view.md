The Catena-X-Standards Demand- and Capacity-Management enable participants of the automotive supply chain to become more resilient thanks to a higher degree of collaboration aimed at avoiding or solving production bottlenecks or too low capacity planning in a tactical horizon of 1-2 years

## Status Quo

**Today's challenge for automotive companies**
Resilience has become imperative within Supply Chain Management, especially over the past years. With the growing complexity of supply chains and a rising number of global and local crises, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as large enterprises (LEs) are facing an increased risk of disruptions in their supply chains, often resulting in bottlenecks and ultimately leading to production shutdowns.

Inside the volatile and highly complex surroundings of the automotive industry nowadays, mostly tailor-made, proprietary and often fully manual IT solutions support the planning processes along the value chain. There is no common understanding of these processes among the participants, the data exchanged is often not aligned or up to date, thus leading to increased process costs and bullwhip effects.

## Why DCM KIT?

The purpose and focus of Demand and Capacity Management (DCM) KIT is twofold:

- Define a common understanding of the DCM process thus paving the way for more proactive and efficient collaboration.
- Ensure process and application interoperability with the help of common semantics and unified interfaces for data exchange.

Implementing the DCM standards will add the following core capabilities to business applications:

- Provisioning of material demands data in a sovereign manner.
- Provisioning of capacity data in a sovereign manner.
- Discovery of bottlenecks and surplus capacity situations by employing a unified calculation logic.

(Coming soon) The DCM standard comprises three main elements:

- **Core Business logic** –to focus on a **common understanding** of the **DCM processes** among the participants.
- **APIs** –to make sure that data are transmitted and collected properly.
- **Data model** –to structure the sharing of **aligned** data and enable the adoption of the core business logic without misinterpretation.

## POWER of STANDARD

Standards create trust. Customer and Supplier can form new partnerships confidently. Knowing that integration in the network will be dramatically simplified. Standardization can help reduce costs by eliminating redundancies and streamlining processes. By adopting a common set of practices and technologies, businesses can avoid the need to develop their own proprietary systems, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

## DATA SOVEREIGNTY in FOCUS

DCM KIT keeps up with Catena X commitment to data sovereignty. This KIT has the goal to always comply with the data sovereignty principle set through implemented by the Eclipse Dataspace Connector. That enables all participants (customer, supplier and application provider) to always stay in full control of their own data.

This is how sharing data is fun.

## INTEROPERABILITY at its BEST

Application and Service Provider can reduce investments to integrate DCM data models/API specification from DCM KIT.

The Kit enables the offering of value-add services and innovation based on process description of the core business logic and how a collaborative approach is a win-win-situation for customer and supplier.

## COLLABORATION is KEY

The DCM KIT enables better and faster issue resolution. We believe that collaboration is the key to creating and maintaining strong partnerships between customers and suppliers and, at the same time, enhancing problem solving to reach a more balanced and efficient supply and demand management.

Of course, by realizing efficiency through improved collaboration all involved partners will gain competitive advantage over those that do not collaborate.

Trace-X empowers all companies from SMEs to large OEMs to participate in parts traceability with an Open-Source solution.

The Open-Source Traceability application is developed within the Catena-X project and enables all companies to participate in Parts Traceability.
Trace-X offers capabilities to ingest data for serialized parts and batches as well as their child components.  Within CX, we strive to establish a standardized, data-sovereign and interoperable exchange of traceability data along the value creation chain.

The application gives an overview of the supplier network and the supply chain. A high level of transparency across the supplier network enables faster intervention based on recorded events in the supply chain. Additionally, automated massages regarding Quality related incidents.
All this saves' costs by seamlessly tracking parts as well as creates trust through clearly defined and secure data access by the companies and persons involved in the process.

Applying and using the Item Relationship Service had the following benefits:  

* With the decision using the IRS we could speed our development of Trace-X through out the scope of their helm charts including a running service with test data. That alone was very benefitial to have a stable environment with data  
* The IRS fulfills a high level of quality in code which provides a reliable service
* The deployment via helm charts has been built so that it can fit in existing architecture components through out configuration like the Digital Twin Registry, the EDC, Semantic Hub, Keycloack and others. This enabled Trace-X to configure the Service smoothly into the architecture of the application
* The IRS abstracts the communication with partners along the supply chain, that makes it easy to build business processes on that. It abstracts a technical level to a logical level to enhance the speed of implementation of a Software Provider
* The IRS with the standardized API provides a data interoperability level on data chains
* The Team behind the IRS is fast in implementing and adapting  new features

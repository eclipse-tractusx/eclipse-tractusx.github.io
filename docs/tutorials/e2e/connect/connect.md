The `Connect Chapter` describes step by step **how to setup your local environment** of your own data space including a kubernetes cluster, services, networking and security.

:::info

Make sure that you have understood and carried out all the steps in the `Prerequisites chapter` before you start deploying the components.

:::

On this stack you will **deploy the components** that you need for data provisioning and data consumption (decentral components). Along with that you will deploy all the components that simulate the core service provider in our data space (central components).

You will use the technology of **Umbrella Helm Charts** to configure and deploy your environment. The Umbrella Helm Chart will contain the components shown in the following table.

|Quantity|Component|Function|Version|Type|GitHub-Link|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Portal|The Portal is designed to work with the IAM.|1.8.1|Central Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal)|
|1|Central IdP|The Identity Provider (IdP) authenticates users and provides identity information to service providers, enabling secure access to applications and services.|2.1.0|Central Component||
|1|Shared IdP|An Identity Provider (IdP) authenticates users and provides identity information to service providers, enabling secure access to applications and services.|2.1.0|Central Component||
|1|Discovery Finder|The Discovery Finder is used to find endpoints of BPN Discoveries for a specific type, e.g. "oen".|0.2.2|Central Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-discovery-finder)|
|1|BPN Discovery|The BPN Discovery is used to lookup for a specific type/key-combination to a Business Partner Number (BPN). For example looking for a combination "oen / oen-133" will lead to "BPNLXYZ123".|0.2.2|Central Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-bpn-discovery)|
|1|SD Factory|Self-Description Factory (SD-Factory) component is responsible for the creation of Self Descriptions.|2.1.19|Central Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sd-factory)|
|1|Managed Identity Wallet|The Managed Identity Wallets (MIW) service implements the Self-Sovereign-Identity (SSI) using did:web.|0.4.0|Central Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/managed-identity-wallet)|
|1|Semantic Hub|The Semantic Hub in Catena-X is a central element for supporting semantic interoperability within the network.|0.2.2|Central Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-hub)|
|3|Eclipse Dataspace Connector|The Eclipse Dataspace Connector enables secure and controlled data sharing and usage within dataspaces, creating interoperability and trust between different organisations.|0.5.3|Decentral Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-edc)|
|3|Vault|A vault is used for the secure storage, management and access control of sensitive data such as secrets, tokens, passwords and encryption keys.|0.20.0|Decentral Component||
|1|Digital Twin Registry (DTR)|Digital twins can be registered in the Digital Twin Registry so that they can be found by other participants.|0.4.5|Decentral Component|[Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-digital-twin-registry)|
|1|Simple Data Backend|The Simple Databackend simulates a backend, i.e. a place where the digital twins are stored.|0.1.0|Decentral Component||

:::info

This tutorial is

- designed for developers who want to get their hands dirty, for companies that want to perform data exchange in actual Catena-X data space infrastructure and generally for curious minds who want to explore dataspaces.
- a pre configured closed environment in one Kubernetes cluster, where the different services located in docker containers communicate within their joint kubernetes cluster, generated by minikube.

:::

:::warning

This tutorial is [not]

- a production environment
- designed to work across different locations

:::

We now will start with the next section `Deploying the Components` where you will deploy the components listed in the table.

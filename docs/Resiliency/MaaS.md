<!--VISION of the Kit-->
## Enable on-demand manufacturing in an interoperable, federated network of manufacturing networks by linking demand with capacities and capabilities

<!--MISSION of the Kit-->
The Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) Kit defines the mechanisms and services needed for an interoperable, federated network of networks, where manufacturing demand meets manufacturing capacities and capabilities.

See [Status Quo](#status-quo) below for more details on Manufacturing-as-a-Service.

The MaaS Kit provides a comprehensive reference architecture with standardized interfaces and data models, including first implemented services to show the operating network of networks with a single-entry point into the world of on-demand manufacturing (ODM) independent of domain. The main focus is on facilitating the intermediation of manufacturing supply as a service and manufacturing demand. In addition, IT services enable the connectivity and process automation for being part of this digital marketplace.

The MAAS Kit is continuously under development and future extensions and improvements will help you to adopt or extend functionality even faster.

<!--BUSINESS VALUE of the Kit-->
### Minimize risk of operations

The available reference architecture supports operators of networks and services to minimize risk while operating Manufacturing-as-a-Service applications.

### Reduce development time

The time to develop integrations of additional solutions or stakeholders (e.g. consumers or suppliers of on-demand manufacturing) to existing networks are drastically cut through well-defined, standardised interfaces and data models.

### Low threshold entry to marketplace

Existing examples of implemented services enable quick entry for consumers and suppliers of on-demand manufacturing to the marketplace that facilitates the intermediation of manufacturing supply as a service and manufacturing demand.

### Cut leadtime for manufacturing transactions

IT services to enable connectivity and process automation to further streamline the interaction between consumer and supplier of on-demand manufacturing.

<!--Description of the domain for which the Kit provide the developer support-->
## Status Quo

Manufacturing-as-a-Service is the practice of connecting consumers and providers of on-demand manufacturing capabilities in a Catena-X context both directly and through integration of other on-demand platforms. The overall aim is to increase resilience against fluctuating demand through one single-entry point for different manufacturing domains.

By requesting components over a graphical user interface, the MaaS portal, component buyers primarily have the value of finding alternative suppliers at short notice, that are definitely able to manufacture the required components.

Manufacturers and ODM platforms primarily gain value in the MaaS portal by offering manufacturing capabilities as suppliers. In this way, suppliers can compensate for fluctuations in demand from their conventional customers by being able to get orders from an alternative sales channel without having to invest great effort in sales activities.
Both sides also benefit from the security and data sovereignty advantages of the Catena-X environment.

## Project Structure

Following our project structure, the collection of our KITs documentation is developed in the `./docs-kits/kits` folder, where each KIT is a subfolder called by its name for organisation purposes. The `Data Chain KIT`, for example, is defined here: `./docs-kits/kits/Data Chain Kit`.

Each folder/KIT's content is structured in at least four pages/subfolders:

- Adoption View -> `page_adoption-view.md`
- Software Operation View -> `page_software-operation-view.md`
- Documentation -> `page_documentation.md`
- Software Development View/
  - Specification -> `page_software-development-view.md`
  - OpenAPI definition/
  - Another OpenAPI definition/
  - ...

## Steps to add a NewKit documentation

1. Create a folder under the `./docs/kits` with the name of the KIT you are developing the documentation of

    ```md
    root
    └── docs-kits
        └── kits
            └── NewKIT
    ```

2. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `page_adoption-view.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs-kits
        └── kits
            └── NewKIT
                └── page_adoption-view.md
    ```

3. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `page_software-operation-view.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs-kits
        └── kits
            └── NewKIT
                ├── page_adoption-view.md
                └── page_software-operation-view.md
    ```

4. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `page_documentation.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs-kits
        └── kits
            └── NewKIT
                ├── page_adoption-view.md
                ├── page_software-operation-view.md
                └── page_documentation.md
    ```

5. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `Software Development View` folder that contains a `page_software-development-view.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs-kits
        └── kits
            └── NewKIT
                ├── page_adoption-view.md
                ├── page_software-operation-view.md
                ├── page_documentation.md
                └── Software Development View
                    └──page_software-development-view.md
    ```

6. To generate the `OpenAPI` based documentation of your KIT, please consult the [Plugins section](/docs/website-guidelines/wiki#plugins) to configure your instance of the `Docusaurus-OpenAPI-Docs` in the `docusaurus.config.js`.

7. Add your newly created KIT documentation to the Kits `sidebar` page, by incorporating the following declaration in the sidebar object of the `sidebar.js` file:

    ```javascript
    const sidebars = {
    // other sidebars
    kits: [
        // copy from here...
        {
        type: "category",
        label: "New KIT name", //change here according your KIT
        link: {
            type: "generated-index",
        },
        collapsed: true,
        items: [
            {
            type: "autogenerated",
            dirName: "kits/New KIT folder name given", //change here according your KIT
            },
        ],
        },
        // ...until here.
    ],
    };
    ```

    **Note** the sidebars may required bigger customisation based on your requirements, for that matters consult the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.2.0/sidebar)

8. After the NewKIT documentation and the corresponding `sidebar` are created, you would want to make it accessible from the `NavBar` of the page. More specifically under the `KITs dropdown menu`. This is easily handled by `Docusaurus` in the `docusaurus.config.js` file, where you'll need to add to the existing `navbar` object your newly created `route` and `label` (name of kit) to be added as a `dropdown` menu item. More specifically in:

    ```javascript
    themeConfig:
    /** @type {import('@docusaurus/preset-classic').ThemeConfig} */
    ({
      // ...
      navbar: {
        title: 'Eclipse Tractus-X',
        logo: {
          alt: 'Eclipse Tractus-X logo',
          src: 'img/logo_tractus-x.svg',
        },
        items: [
          // ...
          {
            type: 'dropdown',
            label: 'KITs',
            position: 'left',
            to: '/Kits',
            items: [
              {
                to: '/docs-kits/kits/Business%20Partner%20Kit/Adoption%20View',
                label: 'Business Partner',
              },
              {
                to: '/docs-kits/kits/Data%20Chain%20Kit/Adoption%20View',
                label: 'Data Chain',
              },
              {
                to: '/docs-kits/kits/tractusx-edc/docs/kit/adoption-view/Adoption%20View',
                label: 'Connector',
              },
              {
                to: '/docs-kits/kits/Traceability%20Kit/Adoption%20View%20Traceability%20Kit',
                label: 'Traceability',
              },
              // ********* add here your object specifying "to" and "label" *********** 
            ],
          },
          // ...
        ]
      }
      // ...
    })
    ```

To know more about the `NavBar` options and how to implement this and other features in it please check the [Docusaurus - NavBar Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.2.0/api/themes/configuration#navbar-dropdown)

## Important to know

The results of your newly created _KIT_ will be visible only (for now) in the `Next` version of the documentation. When a `new version` is due to be created, all of your additions plus the ones from other _KITs_ will be taking part of said new released. To understand more about how `Docusaurus` handle the [versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.2.0/versioning) and more specifically the [versioning of multi-instance](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.2.0/docs-multi-instance) projects, please check the official documentation.

To access the `Next` and the rest of the versions, you'll notice a `dropdown` menu with all of them in the `top-right` corner of the `NavBar` that is only been displayed when the user is navigating any of the existing `KITs`.

Please check our [Understanding our multi-instance and versioning behaviour](/docs/website-guidelines/understanding-multi-instance_versioning) page, where we explain a little bit more in deep the structure of the project, the different instances of documentation, how to create versions and how the conditional rendering of the `versions dropdown` menu is been handled.

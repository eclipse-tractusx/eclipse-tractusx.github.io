## Project Structure

Following our project structure, the collection of our KITs documentation is developed in the `./docs/kits` folder, where each KIT is a subfolder called by its name for organisation purposes. The `Data Chain KIT`, for example, is defined here: `./docs/kits/Data Chain Kit`.

Each folder/KIT's content is structured in at least four pages/subfolders:

- Adoption View -> `page_adoption-view.md`
- Software Operation View -> `page_software-operation-view.md`
- Documentation -> `page_documentation.md`
- Software Development View/
  - Specification -> `page_software-development-view.md`
  - OpenAPI definition/
  - Another OpenAPI definition/
  - ...

## Steps to add a NewKit documentation

1. Create a folder under the `./docs/kits` with the name of the KIT you are developing the documentation of

    ```md
    root
    └── docs
        └── NewKIT
    ```

2. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `page_adoption-view.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs
        └── NewKIT
            └── page_adoption-view.md
    ```

3. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `page_software-operation-view.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs
        └── NewKIT
            ├── page_adoption-view.md
            └── page_software-operation-view.md
    ```

4. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `page_documentation.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs
        └── NewKIT
            ├── page_adoption-view.md
            ├── page_software-operation-view.md
            └── page_documentation.md
    ```

5. Inside the `NewKIT` folder, add a `Software Development View` folder that contains a `page_software-development-view.md` file with the content that suits your use case

    ```md
    root
    └── docs
        └── NewKIT
            ├── page_adoption-view.md
            ├── page_software-operation-view.md
            ├── page_documentation.md
            └── Software Development View
                └──page_software-development-view.md
    ```

6. To generate the `OpenAPI` based documentation of your KIT, please consult the [Plugins section](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/wiki#plugins) to configure your instance of the `Docusaurus-OpenAPI-Docs` in the `docusaurus.config.js`.

7. Add your newly created KIT documentation to the Kits `sidebar` page, by incorporating the following declaration in the sidebar object of the `sidebar.js` file:

    ```javascript
    const sidebars = {
    // other sidebars
    kits: [
        // copy from here...
        {
        type: "category",
        label: "New KIT name", //change here according your KIT
        link: {
            type: "generated-index",
        },
        collapsed: true,
        items: [
            {
            type: "autogenerated",
            dirName: "kits/New KIT folder name given", //change here according your KIT
            },
        ],
        },
        // ...until here.
    ],
    };
    ```

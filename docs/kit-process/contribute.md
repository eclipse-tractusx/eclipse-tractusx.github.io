## How to contribute

If you and your team want to contribute to an existing KIT or even suggest and work on an own KIT you have to fufill a small set of Prerequisites.

1. Each member of your who will contribute to a project must be an eclipse foundation contributor. To become a contributer one must create an account at the eclipse foundation.

   - [Register at the eclipse foundation](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register)

     While registring make sure to use your **email used for your github account**! There are automated checks in place that make sure a commited change is done by an eclipse contributer, it will be rejected otherwise!

   - After finishing your registration process sign the eclipse contributer Agreement to become an eclipse contributer. This process may take a few days. Usually it is finalized the next day.

2. Make yourself familiar with git best practices, the eclipse contribution guidelines and our processes.

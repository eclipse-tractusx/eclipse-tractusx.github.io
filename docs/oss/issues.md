In the Eclipse infrastructure there are different issue trackers for different purposes.

## GitHub Issues related to a repository

Put there all issues related to your code, development. You are free to define your own rules, e.g. naming conventions.
E.g. [issues for this webpage](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/issues)

## [Eclipse Foundation Helpdesk](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/?search=tractus&sort=created_date&state=opened&first_page_size=100)

Here all requests for Eclipse infrastructure  go in.

- Start the summary with "tractus-x" prefix
- If you are not a committer, create the ticket and add a committer to request a "thumbs up" for approval

Welcome to Eclipse Tractus-X!

This page provides information and links to relevant resources before you start contributing to Eclipse Tractus-X.

## Create / configure accounts

For contributing to the Eclipse Tractus-X project you need an Eclipse Foundation and a GitHub account. Contributing means e.g. creating a pull request, adding documentation, opening issues to commenting existing artifacts. So everything adding to the repositories. Without the accounts (properly configured) you have read-only permissions.

### GitHub Account

#### Create

- Create GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup)

#### Configure

- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Add your email, you are using for your Eclipse account, to your GitHub account

### Eclipse Foundation account

#### Create

- Create Eclipse Foundation account [here](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register)
- Use the same email address that you use in GitHub for your contributions, e.g. if you contribute on behalf of your company, you should create the account with your company email address
- Sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)

#### Configure

- Add your **GitHub ID** to your Eclipse profile (Section: Social Media Links)

## Extended Contributor Permissions

There is the possibility to get some [additional rights](/docs/oss/contributor-committer#official-project-contributor) on the GitHub repositories with the official Tractus-X project contributor role.

- Open an issue in sig-infra via this [issue template](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra/issues/new?assignees=&labels=support&projects=&template=support-add-project-contributor.md&title=New+Tractus-X+project+contributor)
- Assign the issue to a committer from the [committer list](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx/who) to onboard you into the Eclipse Tractus-X GitHub organization, since every committer can add project contributors
- Accept the email invitation from GitHub to join the [automotive-tractusx-contributors team at GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/teams)

## Meet the Eclipse Foundation Team at the Eclipse Office Hours

Text from the EF:

"The EMO hosts a monthly call to discuss the Eclipse Foundation Development Process, changes to the Eclipse IP Policy and Due Diligence Process, and other related topics. All Eclipse open source project committers are invited to join. The format is flexible: we generally start with a very short presentation followed by a question and answer session. Bring your questions and the Eclipse Management Organization team will try to provide answers."

Next call: see [calendar](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/calendar/)

Note: the time in the calendar is GMT

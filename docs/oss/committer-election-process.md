title: Committer Election Process
sidebar_position: 40
---

Applying the meritocracy principle to open source development, the more a person contributes, the more responsibility it may take. This principle has been incorporated by the Eclipse Foundation by allowing committers to promote a contributor to a committer ([Eclipse Foundation Handbook, Committer Elections](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#elections-committer)). This page addresses the following questions in the committer journey:

- How do I become a committer process-wise? (committer prospect perspective)
- How to promote a contributer? (committer perspective)

:::warning[Reminder to committers starting elections: It's about the task fit and trust!]
Committers are not to be voted because of popularity or what they might do in future. They need to proof they've fulfilled the tasks, we see in a committer's duties, in the past. Further they must be transparent, open and trusted. If we don't think someone will in future always remain that way, we **MUST NOT** not promote them.
:::

The following steps summarize the handbook on the committer election process:

1. Start a committer election (2 weeks)
2. Committers in the project vote (accept, deny, obtain) with a reason
3. After the committer election has been closed, the project leads and the project management committee (see [roles](./contributor-committer.md)) decide based on the committer votes
4. If the contributor has been accepted, then there is some paperwork to do with the Eclipse Foundation

## Starting a Committer Election

This is the most crucial part about the committer election. The committer election is commonly prepared by the contributor and the commiter - we only promote persons who want to be promoted. Together they decide on how much contribution ([Eclipse Foundation Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#elections-contribution)) is enough following the [eclipse tractus-x expectations of the committer role](./contributor-committer.md#committer).

To provide a useful heuristic for a nomination, we **RECOMMEND** the following template. Remember that the evaluation (with checking the linked information) MUST NOT take a committer more than 15 minutes. While the template provides up to 13 links to issues and pull requests, we **RECOMMEND** 7 links at maximum. Thus, pick examples of good work.

There is neither styling not hypertext allowed. The election text relies on bare text formmatting (none). Thus links are not embedded.

The committer then needs:

- to file a committer election via [eclipse foundation's project page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx/nominate/CM) ("Nominate a Committer")
- send a mail via the [dev mailing list](./how-to-contribute.md#dev-mailinglist)

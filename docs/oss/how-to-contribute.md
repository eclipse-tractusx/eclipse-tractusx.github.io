Contributing to the Eclipse Tractus-X project means code, documentation, creating and solving issues (bugs), answering
questions in public systems e.g. on the dev mailing list to support the community in an open and transparent way. See
also the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing).

This page will contain guidelines and good practices on contributions to Eclipse Tractus-X.

## Repo permissions

All Eclipse Tractus-X repositories are publicly visible, so everybody can read repository contents.
Write permissions are only granted to people with the "Committer role".
See the [Committer role description in the Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-cm), or read through
[our own summary of Eclipse Foundation project roles](./contributor-committer.md).

## Code

- Do all reviews and PRs in Tractus-X repositories, if this is done on fork, there is a leak in openess and
  transparency.
- Write meaningful and descriptive commit messages, look for example [here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
  , [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/your-git-commit-history-should-read-like-a-history-book-heres-how-7f44d5df1801)
  or here for [conventional committs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Avoid references to closed systems, as this is not tracable for newcomers.

## Documentation

Same recommendations like for code contributions.

## Dev Mailinglist

The [dev mailinglist](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-dev-list) is the official channel for project
communication, use it for questions, announcing news or discuss relevant topics.

All of the answers don’t need to necessarily come from project committers: empower your community to answer questions.
When community members do provide answers that require further clarification (either they are not complete, or are not
100% correct), do so politely. The more welcome you make your community feel, the more likely it is that your project
will be successful.

Mail address: [tractusx-dev@eclipse.org](mailto:tractusx-dev@eclipse.org)

Every contributor should be subscribed to
the [Eclipse Tractus-X Developer Mailingliste](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev). Committers have
to be subscribed to the list and are added automatically when gaining the committer status.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or you have a request or proposal for e.g. a new feature, open an issue. This is an important part of
doing development in an open and transparent way and is also used for documentation.
More [information about the different issue tracker](/docs/oss/issues).

See the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#community-issues)

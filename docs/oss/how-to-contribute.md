 Contributing to the Eclipse Tractus-X project means code, documentation, creating and solving issues (bugs), answering questions in public systems e.g. on the dev mailing list to support the community in an open and transparent way. See also the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing).

This page will contain guidelines and good practices on contributions to Eclipse Tractus-X.

## Code

- Do all reviews and PRs in TractusX repositories, if this is done on fork, there is a leak in openess and transpareny
- Write meaningful and descriptive commit messages, look for example [here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/your-git-commit-history-should-read-like-a-history-book-heres-how-7f44d5df1801) or here for [conventional committs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Avoid references to closed systems, as this is not tracable for newcomers
-

## Documentation

Same recommondations like for code contributions.

## Dev Mailinglist

The [dev mailinglist]((https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-dev-list)) is the official channel for project communication, use it for questions, announcing news or discuss relevant topics.

All of the answers don’t need to necessarily come from project committers: empower your community to answer questions. When community members do provide answers that require further clarification (either they are not complete, or are not 100% correct), do so politely.
The more welcome you make your community feel, the more likely it is that your project will be successful.

Mail adress: tractusx-dev@eclipse.org

Every contributor should be subscribed to the [Eclipse Tractus-X Developer Mailingliste](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev). Committers have to be subscripbed to the list and are added automatically when gaining the committer status.

## Reporting Issues

Reporting issues a an important part of doing development in an open and transparent way.
It is also used for documentation.

See the [Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#community-issues)

## Why

The purpose of this guideline is to establish a standardized process for hosting APIs using GitHub Pages within our GitHub organization. This ensures consistency, transparency, and accessibility of API documentation, while also promoting collaboration among teams responsible for API development.

## Description

Products willing to publish API hosted on dedicated Tractus-X repository using Github Pages need to adhere to following rules:

- Teams generate the OpenAPI specification file (in YAML format) describing the API endpoints, parameters, responses, etc.
- Name the OpenAPI spec file as `productname_openapi.yaml`, where `productname` is the name of the API product.
- Whenever a team wants to release a new version of the API:
  - Update the OpenAPI specification file (productname_openapi.yaml) and version parameter.
  - Create a new release in the repository.
  - Attach the OpenAPI specification file (productname_openapi.yaml) as an artifact to the release.

### Best practice

- Leverage release workflow to build openapi spec and upload it to created github release.

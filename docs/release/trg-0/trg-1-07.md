## Why

End-User Manual is essential for providing user assistance and ensuring a positive user experience. The user of the application is the receipient of this documentation. Typical contents are screenshots, description of functionality and steps that guide through critical processes.

## Description

- The End-User Manual **has to** be stored in the folder: ```docs/user/```
- End-User Manual is available with the software at the same time.
- End-User Manual is correct and up to date; English is a must.
- The documentation is of appropriate maturity to be handed over to any Operations Company with global business practice intentions.
- In Markdown format. Link to the document available. Must point to the leading repository within Tractus-X.

## Best Practice

- Schedule an appointment with Architect to obtain approval prior to Gate review.
- Provide a link to documentation as early as possible and mark changes to the previous version (if applicable); expect optimization loops based on feedback.

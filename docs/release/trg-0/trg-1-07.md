## Best Practice

- Schedule an appointment with Architect to obtain approval prior to Gate review.
- Provide a link to documentation as early as possible and mark changes to the previous version (if applicable); expect optimization loops based on feedback.

User assistance ensures that, for example, administrators get all the information they need to accomplish their tasks with the software. Refer to an administration guide, which covers "install/deploy, configure the software" â€“ as appropriate for the type of software and the information needs of the target group(s). UI text and embedded help complete the User assistance.

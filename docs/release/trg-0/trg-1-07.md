## Description

Users of the application are the recipients of this documentation. In case as application by default doesn`t address end-users, an enduser manual is not required.
The Enduser manual is essential for providing user assistance and ensuring a positive user experience. Typical contents are screenshots, description of functionality and steps that guide through critical processes.

- The End-User Manual **must** be stored in markdown format ".md" in the folder: ```docs/user/```.

## Best Practice

- The Enduser manual is in sync with the latest released version of the component. It is checked and updated, once an up-revision is foreseen.
- The content is of appropriate maturity, so that any Operations Company with global business practice intentions is invited to use and build on it.
- Anchor a link to your Enduser manual within your readme.md (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1)).

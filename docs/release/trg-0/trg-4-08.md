## Why

Providing container images that support multiple CPU architectures enhances flexibility, compatibility, and efficiency across hardware devices.

This is especially beneficial for supporting use cases like tutorials and local playgrounds.

## Description

Container images **must** be built for **amd64 and arm64** CPU architectures.

### Implementation

Make sure to choose a base image, out of the list in [TRG 4.02](../trg-4/trg-4-02.md#aligned-base-images) which is built for amd64 and arm64 CPU architecture, (e.g. [eclipse-temurin/tags?page=1&name=21-jre-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin/tags?page=1&name=21-jre-alpine)) and enable the image build workflow: the example workflow from [TRG 4.01](../trg-4/trg-4-01.md) contains the necessary steps for building a multi-platform image.

## Why

Providing container images that support multiple CPU architectures enhances flexibility, compatibility, and efficiency across hardware devices.

This is especially beneficial for supporting use cases like tutorials and local playgrounds.

## Description

Container images **must** be built for **amd64 and arm64** CPU architectures.

### Implementation

The example workflow from [TRG 4.01](../trg-4/trg-4-01.md) contains the necessary steps for building a multi-platform image.

## Why

Providing container images that support multiple CPU architectures enhances flexibility, compatibility, and efficiency across hardware devices.

This is especially beneficial for supporting use cases like tutorials and local playgrounds.

## Description

Container images **must** be built for **amd64 and arm64** CPU architectures.

### Implementation

Add and enhance the GitHub Workflow with the following steps:

```yaml
name: Build - Docker image (SemVer)

...

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      packages: write

    steps:
      ...
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v3

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
           context: .
           platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64
           ...
      ...
```

## Why

Interfaces Documentation is crucial for integration testing and ensuring seamless interoperability.

- Request context must be clear (sequence of API calls)

>Who is the audience/adressant of the document?
>
> Location in repo:
>```docs>arch>InterfacesDoc.md``` Folder
>
> API-Swagger-File

## Description

- API documentation contains all relevant interfaces for integration testing and is completed for the relevant product version.
- Link to the document is available.

Interface contract signed by all involved parties.

De-central:

## Best Practice

- Schedule an appointment with Architect to obtain approval prior to Gate review.
- Provide a link to documentation as early as possible and mark changes to the previous version (if applicable); expect optimization loops based on feedback.

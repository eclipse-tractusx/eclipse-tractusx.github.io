## Why

Interfaces Documentation is crucial for integration testing and ensuring seamless interoperability for Developers consuming the product API

## Description

- The interface documentation **has to** be stored in the folder: ```docs/interfaces/```
- API documentation contains all relevant interfaces for integration testing and is completed for the relevant product version.
- The context of the request **has to** be clear (sequence of API calls)
- Link to the API-Swagger-File is available.
- Functional and non-functional commitment of the interface.

## Best Practice

- Schedule an appointment with architect to obtain approval prior to gate review.
- Provide a link to documentation as early as possible and mark changes to the previous version (if applicable); expect optimization loops based on feedback.
- example: [BPDM Country Risk Interface Docu](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/vas-country-risk/blob/main/docs/Arc42-Documentation.md#interfaces)
- [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/)

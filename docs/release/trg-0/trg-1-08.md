## Why

Interface documentation is crucial to interact with your FOSS component: it fundamentally enables others to consume your APIs.

## Description

- API documentation contains all interfaces. It **must** be up-to-date for the latest released component version. The interface documentation must be stored in the folder ```/docs/api```.

- Functional and non-functional commitment of the interface.

## Best Practice

- adhere to standards like Swagger or openAPI
- consider functional and non-functional comittments of each interface
- context of a request must be clear (sequence of API calls)
- anchor a link to your Interface documentation within your readme.md (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1)).

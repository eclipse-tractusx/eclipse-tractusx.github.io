## Why

This TRG serves to maintain a **consistent structure** and ensure **content quality** for the stakeholders.

KIT means Keep It Together. A KIT contains all the artifacts that are relevant to participate in the Catena-X data space as an operator, data provider or solution / app provider. These stakeholders have one place with all the information they need. For example an explanation of an API, the specification of it and the deployment instructions. The goal of a KIT should be that you have no need to visit any other information source.

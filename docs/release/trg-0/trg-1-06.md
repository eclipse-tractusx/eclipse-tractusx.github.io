## Why

Administrator's Guide is intended for administrators that install and operate the solution.

## Description

- The Admin Guide **has to** be stored in the folder: ```docs/admin/```
- Admin Guide is available with the software at the same time.
- Admin Guide is correct and up to date; English is a must.
- The documentation is of appropriate maturity to be handed over to any Operations Company with global business practice intentions.
- In Markdown format. Link to the document available. Must point to the leading repository within Tractus-X.

## Best Practice

- Schedule an appointment with Architect to obtain approval prior to Gate review.
- Provide a link to documentation as early as possible and mark changes to the previous version (if applicable); expect optimization loops based on feedback.

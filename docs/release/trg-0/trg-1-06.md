| Draft  | 21-Mar-2024  | Transferred from Release Acceptance Criteria into TRG |

## Why

Tractus-X components and applications may be operated in various productive environments. An Administrator`s guide shall help operators to install and operate the solution. It can also be a vehicle to share best-practices on maintenance etc.

## Description

- The Admin Guide **must** be stored in markdown format ".md" in the folder: `/docs/admin/`
- Admin Guide is available with the software at the same time
- English is a must
- The documentation is of appropriate maturity to be handed over to any Operations Company with global business practice intentions
- In Markdown format. Link to the document available. Must point to the leading repository within Tractus-X

## Best Practice

- The Admin guide is in sync with the latest released version of the component. It is checked and updated, once an up-revision is foreseen
- The content is of appropriate maturity, so that any Operations Company with global business practice intentions is invited to use and build on it
- Anchor a link to your Admin guide within your `README.md` (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1))

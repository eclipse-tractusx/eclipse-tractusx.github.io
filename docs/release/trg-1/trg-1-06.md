## Why

Tractus-X components and applications may be operated in various productive environments. An Administrator`s guide **shall** help operators to install and operate the solution. It can also be a vehicle to share best-practices on maintenance etc.

## Description

- The Admin Guide **must** be stored in the folder: `/docs/admin`
  - It is up-to-date for every release
  - English is a **must**
- The `/docs/README.md` describes shortly what documentation is available

## Best Practice

- Favor diagrams as mermaid block in `.md` files directly over image files, where possible
- Have a look to peer repositories within Tractus-X for inspiration
- Anchor a link to your admin guide within your `README.md` (see [TRG 1.01](/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-01))

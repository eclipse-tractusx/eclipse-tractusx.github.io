## Why

End user manual is essential for providing user assistance and ensuring a positive user experience. The user of the application is the recipient of this documentation. Typical contents are description of functionality, steps that guide through critical processes and screenshots.

## Description

- The end user manual **must** be stored in the folder: `/docs/user`
  - It is up-to-date for every release
  - English is a **must**
- The `/docs/README.md` describes shortly what documentation is available

## Best Practice

- Favor diagrams as mermaid block in `.md` files directly over image files, where possible
- Have a look to peer repositories within Tractus-X for inspiration
- Anchor a link to your end user manual within your `README.md` (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1))

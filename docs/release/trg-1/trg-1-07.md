## Why

End user manual is essential for providing user assistance and ensuring a positive user experience. The user of the application is the recipient of this documentation. Typical contents are screenshots, description of functionality and steps that guide through critical processes.

## Description

Users of the application are the recipients of this documentation. In case as application by default doesn't address end users, an end user manual is not required.
The end user manual is essential for providing user assistance and ensuring a positive user experience.

- The end user manual **must** be stored in markdown format ".md" in the folder: `/docs/user/`

## Best Practice

- The end user manual is in sync with the latest released version of the component. It is checked and updated, once an up-revision is foreseen
- The content is of appropriate maturity, so that any Operations Company with global business practice intentions is invited to use and build on it
- Anchor a link to your end user manual within your readme.md (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1))

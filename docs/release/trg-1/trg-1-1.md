## Description

Repositories must contain a appropriate `README.md` file.

## Why

Each repository must contain a `README.md` file which shall cover following topics:

- Basic description of repository and its content
- Installation instructions to get component working
- If required, additional post installation configuration steps to finish installation

If installation instructions are too comprehensive for `README.md` move content to `INSTALL.md` file,
see [TRG 1.2](trg-1-2.md)

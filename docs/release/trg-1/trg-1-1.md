## Why

A good `README.md` file is the starting point for everyone opening your repository. It should help them find all critical information in an easy way.
A well-maintained `README.md` shows high level of professionalism of the project. It shows that the developers care about user experience and want to make it easy for others to understand and use their work.

## Description

Each repository **must** contain a `README.md` file which **shall** cover following topics:

- Basic documentation of the repository, its content and its structure
- Setup and installation instructions
- Configuration and customization if required for additional post installation steps to finish installation
- Usage examples and intended use of your product
- License Information
- Troubleshooting and FAQs to help users solve common problems
- Reference your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file as Contribution guidelines to your project
- Contact information to help users get in touch with you
- Professionalism and integrity for your project
- Badges to show the status of your project (e.g. build status, code coverage, [etc](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/README.md).)

Common questions that are answered in the `README.md` file include:

- If installation instructions for your product are too complex for `README.md` move content to `INSTALL.md` file, see [TRG 1.02](trg-1-2.md).
- If your project is too complex to be described in a single `README.md` file, consider creating a `docs` folder and add additional parts to your documentation and reference it.
- If your project has multiple component repositories, link the other repositories in your leading repository in your `README.md` mutually.

In summary, a good README is a crucial component of any repository, serving as a gateway for users and contributors to understand, use, and potentially contribute to your project. It's a fundamental part of effective project communication and collaboration.

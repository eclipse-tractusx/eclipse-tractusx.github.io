## Why

A good `README.md` file is the starting point for everyone opening a repository. It should help them find all critical information in an easy way.

## Description

Each repository **must** contain a `README.md` file which **shall** cover following topics:

- Basic description of repository and its content
- Installation instructions to get component working
- If required, additional post installation configuration steps to finish installation

If installation instructions are too comprehensive for `README.md` move content to `INSTALL.md` file, see [TRG 1.2](trg-1-2.md).

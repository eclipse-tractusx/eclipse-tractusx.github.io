## Why

A good `README.md` file is the starting point for everyone opening your repository. It should help them find all critical information in an easy way.
A well-maintained README reflects positively on the overall professionalism of the project. It shows that the developers care about user experience and want to make it easy for others to understand and use their work.

## Description

Each repository **must** contain a `README.md` file which **shall** cover following topics:

- Basic documentation of repository and its content to understanding how your repository is structured and what it contains
- Setup and installation instructions to get your component working
- Configuration and customization if required for additional post installation steps to finish installation
- Usage examples and demonstrations of you product
- License Information
- Troubleshooting and FAQs to help users solve common problems
- Contribution guidelines to help users contribute to your project
- Contact information to help users get in touch with you
- Professionalism and integrity for your project
- Badges to show the status of your project (e.g. build status, code coverage, [etc](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/README.md).)

For our open-source eclipse tractus-x project, the `README.md` often includes guidelines on how others can contribute. This may cover aspects like submitting bug reports, suggesting new features, or providing code contributions. Clear contribution guidelines can help streamline collaboration.

Common questions that are answered in the `README.md` file include:

If installation instructions for your product are too comprehensive for `README.md` move content to `INSTALL.md` file, see [TRG 1.02](trg-1-2.md).
If your project is too complex to be described in a single `README.md` file, consider creating a `docs` folder and adding a `README.md` file there. This will help you keep your main repository directory clean and tidy.
If your project has multiple component repositories, link the other repositories in your leading repository in your `README.md` against to it.

In summary, a good README is a crucial component of any repository, serving as a gateway for users and contributors to understand, use, and potentially contribute to your project. It's a fundamental part of effective project communication and collaboration.

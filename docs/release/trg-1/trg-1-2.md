## Why

If a repository contains code which needs to be configured/setup or installed, the `README.md` file should cover this information. If this is too much text, it can be moved into a `INSTALL.md` file.

## Description

Create a `INSTALL.md` file in the main folder of the repository and add all installation relevant information.

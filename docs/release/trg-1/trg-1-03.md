## Why

Tracking changes in Open Source is critical to have a way of knowing which new features have been introduced, which bugs have been fixed, which security CVEs have been mitigated.

This helps people who are using the product, to understand which version to choose or when to upgrade.

## Description

All notable changes of a new release in the product repositories **MUST** be documented. There are two ways to document:

- Recommended: Use the GitHub release notes mechanism to document changes in the Release item in GitHub.
- Alternative: Document all releases with their changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root level in the repository.
  A `CHANGELOG.md` file **SHOULD** follow the format as described in [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

In addition, a link to the change documentation **MUST** be added to the [Eclipse Tractus-X Changelog](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-release/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

The versioning of the product releases **MUST** follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Best Practices and Example for GitHub Release item

- As the release notes mechanism basically gathers merged pull requests in the relevant period, some hygienic activities support the automation process.
  - Separate the changes into adequate categories (e.g., features, bugfixes, documentation, infrastructure, dependencies).
  - Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to support the release notes mechanism in doing a pre-sorting of changes into categories.
  - Cleanup the list to provide a better user experience to adoptors of the version.

### Example GitHub Release item

## Best Practices and Example for `CHANGELOG.md`

- latest released version should be on top
- each released version should have a separate block entry and each version should be linked to the corresponding tag
- use the "unreleased section" to track updates to features or functions of upcoming releases
- same kinds of changes should be grouped (e.g. changed, fixed, removed, etc.) and each change should be linked to the corresponding issue or pull request

### Example `CHANGELOG.md`

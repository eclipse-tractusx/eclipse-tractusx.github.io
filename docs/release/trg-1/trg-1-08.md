## Why

Interface documentation is crucial to interact with components. It fundamentally enables others to consume your APIs.

## Description

- The interface documentation **should** be either stored in the folder `/docs/api` as `openAPI.yaml` or referenced in the `.tractusx` meta file as reachable document (like GitHub release asset) through the `openApiSpecs` key
  - It **must** be in the OpenAPI standard
    - It **must** be at least version 2
  - It **must** contain all interfaces
  - It **must** be up-to-date for the latest released component version

## Best Practice

- consider functional and non-functional commitments of each interface
- make sure that the context of a request is understandable, like the sequence of API calls
- anchor a link to your Interface documentation within your `README.md` (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1))

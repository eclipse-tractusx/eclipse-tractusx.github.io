## Why

Interface documentation is crucial to interact with your FOSS component: it fundamentally enables others to consume your APIs.

## Description

- API documentation contains all interfaces. It **must** be up-to-date for the latest released component version
- The interface documentation must be stored in the folder `/docs/api`
- Functional and non-functional commitment of the interface

## Best Practice

- adhere to standard OpenAPI
- consider functional and non-functional commitments of each interface
- context of a request must be clear (sequence of API calls)
- anchor a link to your Interface documentation within your `README.md` (see [TRG 1.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-1))

## Description

Repositories must contain a `CHANGELOG.md` file and content must
follow [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

## Why

To track changes of releases a `CHANGELOG.md` must be added to repositories. The format must follow the format explained at [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The versioning of releases must
follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). For easy changelog
creation [conventional committing](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) is strongly recommended.

An example of a `CHANGELOG.md` file following _Keep A Changelog_ can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-release/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

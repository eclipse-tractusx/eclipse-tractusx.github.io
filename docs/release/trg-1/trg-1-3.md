## Why

Tracking changes in Open Source is critical to have a way of knowing what new features have been introduced, what bugs have been fixed, what security CVEs have been mitigated.

This helps people, who are using the software, to understand what version to choose or when to upgrade.

## Description

To track changes of releases a `CHANGELOG.md` **must** be added to repositories. The format **should** follow the format
explained at [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The versioning of releases **must** follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). For easy changelog
creation [conventional committing](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) **should** be followed.

An example of a `CHANGELOG.md` file following _Keep A Changelog_ can be
found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractus-x-release/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

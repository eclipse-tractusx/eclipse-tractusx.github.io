## Description

Repositories must contain a appropriate `CHANGELOG.md` file.

## Why

To track changes of releases a `CHANGELOG.md` must be added to repositories. The versioning itself
follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). For easy changelog
creation [conventional committing](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) is strongly recommended.

Recommendations for changelog format will follow.

## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation licensed under the Apache License 2.0 ([Apache-2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)). For non-code the default license is the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International ([CC-BY-4.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html)).

The legal obligations of the content must be observed in all forms of which the content is available.

All products delivered by the projectâ€”including websites, documentation, slides and help must include certain notices. Documentation might include a notice in either the pre- or post-amble, or a website might provide this information in a common footer, or a dedicated page. (From: [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-end-user))

## Description

Eclipse Tractus-X allows the following licenses: Apache-2.0 and CC-BY-4.0 for non-code.

In this TRG, by non-code artifacts we mean e.g. documentation and images embedded in this documentation. All of these artifacts have to include notices about copyright, license and source location information. Excluded are the [legal documentation files](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-01#description).

The CC-BY-4.0 is the default license for non-code. For some documentation it may makes sense to put it under the Apache-2.0 license, especially for technical documentation with code snippets embedded.
There are special cases for the **KIT documentation**, that **must** be licensed under the CC-BY-4.0, see TRG 7-08.

## How to include legal notices

:::tip
Think about "old-fashioned" printed documents: <br/>
Attributions for non-code artifacts, like documentation files, have to be visible for the receiver, that means
it has to be added to the content, **NOT** in comments, metadata, or alt text (images).

### Documentation

In this chapter we show an example of how to do it for a file with md format, licensed under the Apache-2.0, for other formats like slides, pdf, and others the format may be slightly different.

Add a `NOTICE` section (post or preamble) into your dedicated documentation file, with the following information:

```text

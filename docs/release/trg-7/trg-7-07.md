## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation licensed under the Apache License 2.0
([Apache-2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)). For non-code the default license is the Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International ([CC-BY-4.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html)).

The legal obligations of the content must be observed in all forms of which the content is available.

All products delivered by the projectâ€”including websites, documentation, slides, KITS and help must include certain
notices. Documentation might include a notice in either the pre- or post-amble, or a website might provide this
information in a common footer, or a dedicated page.

## Description

Eclipse Tractus-X allows the following licenses: Apache-2.0 and CC-BY-4.0 for non-code.

In this TRG, by non-code artifacts we mean KITs, other documentation including the embedded images, slidesets,
the content of issues or discussion in the Github organization (this is non-exhaustive list). All of these
artifacts have to include notices about copyright, license and source location information. Excluded are the
[legal documentation files](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-01#description).

The CC-BY-4.0 is the default license for non-code. Deviating from the default is an exceptional case! For some
documentation, though, it may makes sense to put it under the Apache-2.0 license, especially for technical
documentation with code snippets embedded.

For the KIT documentation it is recommended to put it under the CC-BY-4.0. The following KIT documentation **MUST**
be licensed under the CC-BY-4.0:

- Adoption View (adoption-view.md)

Self-created content embedded in the listed KIT documentation files under the CC-BY-4.0, have also to be licensed
under the CC-BY-4.0.

Generally self-created artifacts like images, graphics and logos should go under the CC-BY-4.0.

## How to include legal notices

:::tip
Think about "old-fashioned" printed documents: <br/>
Attributions for non-code artifacts, like documentation files, have to be visible for the receiver, that means
it has to be added to the content, **NOT** in comments, metadata, or alt text (images).
:::

See also the [human-readable summary of the CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Documentation

For text files, like files in the markdown format, the attribution is done directly in the file as described in this
section. The attribution is shown with an example for a CC-BY-4.0 licensed markdown file. For other formats like
slides, pdf, and others adapt the information in an adequate way.

Add a `NOTICE` section (post or preamble) into your dedicated documentation file, with the following information:

```text
## NOTICE

- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_doc_or_doc_dir> (+)
```

(+) URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable

:::tip
If there are multiple copyright holders, insert several SPDX-FileCopyrightText lines, for each entry one line.
Explanations in brackets, do not copy. PLEASE.

```text

```

### Self-created content

Self-created non-text content like an image should have the copyright and license information included, whereever
possible, e.g., the information can be added at the bottom of an image.

Example:

```text
COPYRIGHT(C) 202x {owner}[ and others] | THIS WORK IS LICENSED UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL LICENSE (CC BY 4.0)
```

If images (and other file types) cannot be attributed directly, attribution has to consider two distribution paths of
the content.

#### Embedded content in a distributed document

If the file is embedded in a document, that is distributed as standalone document, e.g., as a generated PDF, the
attribution **MUST** be done within the embedding document, either in the caption of the file, e.g., below the place
the file is embedded, or in the notice section as described in the [previous section](#documentation). See an example
for the notice section:

```text
## NOTICE

This work is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022 Owner1
- Image(s): https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_image_or_image_dir>
- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_doc_or_doc_dir>

- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022 Owner2
- Diagram(s): https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_diagram_or_diagram_dir>
```

#### Repository Content

As the file is also provided in the repository and can be consumed there, the attribution **MUST** be done in the
repository as well. This can be done with a workaround. Create a new file with the same name and the `.license` postfix
next to the image with the following content:

```text
This work is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 202x {owner}[ and others]
- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_image_or_image_dir> (+)
 ```

 (+) URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable

**Example:**

```shell
project/
|__ docs/
|   |__ adoption-view.md
|   |__ img/
|      |__ image1.jpg
|      |__ image1.jpg.license
|      |__ image2.png
|      |__ image2.png.license
|__ LICENSE
|__ LICENSE_non-code
```

This is the recommended way of [REUSE Software](https://reuse.software/tutorial/).

If multiple images need to be attributed, the REUSE Software project proposes the use of the `REUSE.toml` file format.
This is an alternative way to specify attributions for many files that cannot be attributed directly like images. This
file can be placed anywhere in a file system hierarchy and allows to refer to many files and provide the necessary
attribution. As the whole concept is a bit more complex but very well described by the REUSE Software project, we refer
at this point to the corresponding [specification](https://reuse.software/spec-3.3/#reusetoml) for further details.

See an example filesystem structure for the `REUSE.toml` file:

```shell
project/
|__ docs/
|   |__ adoption-view.md
|   |__ REUSE.toml
|   |__ img/
|      |__ image1.jpg
|      |__ image2.png
|__ LICENSE
|__ LICENSE_non-code
```

In this example the `REUSE.toml` file contains the following information:

```shell
version = 1

[[annotations]]
path = ["img/*.jpg", "img/*.png"]
precedence = "closest"
SPDX-FileCopyrightText = "202x {owner}[ and others]"
SPDX-License-Identifier = "CC-BY-4.0"
```


### Third-party content

If you third-party content, e.g. images, graphics, logos in your artifacts or repositories, the images have to be attributed
with the following information:

- Title
- Author/Copyright
- License
- Source

The attribution **MUST** be documented as described in the [previous section](#self-created-content), i.e., within the
embedding artifact or using an extra file to store the information. In addition, reference the third-party content in
the repositories NOTICE file at the root level

**Example - photo with direct attribution:**

Direct attribution

```text

Addition for the notice section:

Also add this section to the NOTICE file at root level, section "Third-party content"

```text

## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0). The legal obligations of the content must be observed in all forms of which the content is available.

All products delivered by the projectâ€”including websites, documentation, slides and help must include certain notices. Documentation might include a notice in either the pre- or post-amble, or a website might provide this information in a common footer, or a dedicated page. (From: [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-end-user))

## Description

Eclipse Tractus-X allows two outbound licenses: Apache-2.0 and CC-BY-4.0.
The outbound license is the `LICENSE` that resides at the root level of each repository. Unless otherwise noted, this is the default license for all self-created artifacts in the repository. For all repositories containing code, this is the Apache-2.0 license. An example for a repository licensed under the CC-BY-4.0 are the [semantic models](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models).

In this TRG, by non-code artifacts we mean documentation and images embedded in this documentation. All of these artifacts have to include notices about copyright, license and source location information. Excluded are the [legal documenation files](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-01#description).

There are special cases for the **KIT documentation**, that have to be licensed under the CC-BY-4.0, see TRG 7-08.

## Location of secondary licenses

If you use more then one outbound license, you have to put the "second" license to a `LICENSES/` directory. <br/>
Naming: `<SPDX-License-Identifier>.txt`

**Example:** Apache-2.0 as default license, CC-BY-4.0 as second license

```shell
project/
|__ LICENSE              (<- Apache-2.0)
|__ LICENSES/
|   |__ CC-BY-4.0.txt
| ...
```

## How to include legal notices

:::tip
Think about "old-fashioned" printed documents: <br/>
Attributions for non-code artefacts, like documentation files, have to be visible for the reciever, that means
it has to be added to the content, **NOT** in comments, metadata, or alt text (images).

### Documentation

In this chapter we show an example of how to do it for the md format licensed under the Apache-2.0, for other formats like slides, pdf, and others the format may be slightly different.

Add a `NOTICE` section (post or preamble) into your dedicated documentation file, with the following information:

```text

### Self-created images

Self-created images have as default license the license at root level of your repository (as long you followed the guidelines of having a `LICENSES` directory for secondary licenses).

If your documenation file and the images are in the same repository and have the default license and authorship/copyright is covered by the git history, the NOTICE section above is sufficient.

If not, please see TRG 7.08.

### Third-party content

If you embed third-party content (images) in your artefacts, the images have to be attributed with th following informations:

- Title
- Author/Copyright
- License
- Source

#### Where to put the attribution

- right next to, over or under the image
- **OR** make a clear reference to it and put the attribution in the NOTICE section

**Example - photo with attribution:**

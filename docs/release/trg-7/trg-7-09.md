## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project governed by the Eclipse Foundation and its Committers. Besides the role participating in maintaining the code base, committers are responsible for its security and adherence to the Tractus-X Releases Guideslines (TRG's) as well as the guidelines set by the Eclipse Foundation. As this group of committers is responsible for the whole project and has limited resources, repositories that are not maintained for a given time period will be deprecated.

## Description

Deprecation applies to repositories of type `product`. This information is maintained in the repository metafile (see [TRG 2.05](../trg-2/trg-2-5.md)). Deprecation of a repository means that **the repository is being archived**, i.e. set to status "Public Archive" on Github. It's still accessible from within the project, so that it could be revived. Please refer to [this list for examples of archived repositories within Eclipse Tractus-X](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=).

Additionally the helm charts and container images are still available and no information about the deprecation is passed to the user.

### Criteria for Deprecation

Committers consider the following criteria to propose deprecation of a repository:

1. The repository does not comply with the Tractus-X Releases Guidelines (TRG's) and/or the guidelines set by the Eclipse Foundation (i.e. Security, Intellectual Property, etc.)

In case of repositories belonging to a [Product](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/products):
2. The product of the repository has not been released within the *past year's major release cycle* **\***.
3. The standards used by the product have been changed in a major version within the *past year's major release cycle* **\***.

**\*** The *past year's major release cycle* is the time span between the breaking change releases YY.06 e.g., 24.05 till 24.05.

### Process

To ensure the communities awareness the following process is used at least per major release planning:

    A[1: Prepare list of unmaintained repositories] --> B[2-1 Inform Eclipse Tractus-X community]
    B --> C[2-2: Draft critical issue for committer meeting]
    C --> D[3: 2 week period: Comment on issue for criteria discussion]
    D --> E[4-1: Committer meeting: Discuss list]
    E --> F[4-2: Send email to mailing list]
    F --> G[5: Open Planning: Communicate deprecation proposal during Open Planning]
    G --> H{6: Action taken?}
    H -->|No| I[End of Release: Deprecate repository]
    H -->|Yes| J[Plan Update of repository]
```

1. The committers prepare a list of unmaintained product repositories (**criteria 1**).
2. The committers inform the Eclipse Tractus-X community via the [mailing list](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/how-to-contribute/#dev-mailinglist). This is done by an issue with checkboxes listing all these repositories (find the issue template below). Additionally a critical issue is drafted on the [board for the committer meeting](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/61/views/6) in at least 2 full weeks.
3. 2 weeks period: The committers comment the issue regarding which repositories are subject to **criteria 1** and **criteria 2**. Also if **Criteria 2** does not apply, deprecation may still be possible due to security concerns.
4. Committer meeting: The committers discuss the list and check the boxes in the issue. A Mail is sent out to the Eclipse Tractus-X mailing list. This list is splitted into platform products (e.g. Tractus-X EDC) and use case products (e.g. PURIS). See a template below.
5. During the [Open Planning](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/next/working-model/release-management/planning/tx-release-planning-days) the deprecation proposal is communicated again.
6. If no action is taken, during the Release of the major version, the committers deprecate the repository and inform the association's release management.

## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project governed by the Eclipse Foundation and its Committers. Besides the role participating in maintaining the code base, committers are responsible for its security and adherence to the Tractus-X Releases Guideslines (TRG's) as well as the guidelines set by the Eclipse Foundation. As this group of committers is responsible for the whole project and has limited resources, repositories that are not maintained for a given time period will be deprecated.

## Description

Deprecation applies to repositories of type `product`. This information is maintained in the repository metafile (see [TRG 2.05](../trg-2/trg-2-5.md)). Deprecation of a repository means that **the repository is being archived**, i.e. set to status "Public Archive" on Github. It's still accessible from within the project, so that it could be revived. Please refer to [this list for examples of archived repositories within Eclipse Tractus-X](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=).

Additionally the helm charts and container images are still available and no information about the deprecation is passed to the user.

### Criteria for Deprecation

Committers consider the following criteria to propose deprecation of a repository:

1. The repository does not comply with the Tractus-X Releases Guidelines (TRG's) and/or the guidelines set by the Eclipse Foundation (i.e. Security, Intellectual Property, etc.)

In case of repositories belonging to a [Product](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/community/products):
2. The product of the repository has not been released within the *past year's major release cycle* **\***.
3. The standards used by the product have been changed in a major version within the *past year's major release cycle* **\***.

**\*** The *past year's major release cycle* is the time span between the breaking change releases YY.06 e.g., 24.05 till 24.05.

### Deprecation Process

To ensure the communities awareness the following process is used at least per major release planning:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[1: Prepare list of unmaintained repositories] --> B[2-1: Draft critical issue for committer meeting]
    B --> C[2-2: Inform Eclipse Tractus-X community]
    C --> D[3: 2 week period: Comment on issue for criteria discussion]
    D --> E[4-1: Committer meeting: Discuss list]
    E --> F[4-2: Send email to mailing list]
    F --> G[5: Open Planning: Communicate deprecation proposal during Open Planning]
    G --> H{6: Action taken?}
    H -->|No| I[End of Release: Deprecate repository]
    H -->|Yes| J[Plan Update of repository]
    J --> K[Create issue in .eclipsefdn]
```

1. The committers prepare a list of unmaintained product repositories (**criteria 1**).
2. The committers inform the Eclipse Tractus-X community via the [mailing list](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/how-to-contribute/#dev-mailinglist). This is done by an issue with checkboxes listing all these repositories (find the issue template [below](#issue-template-for-deprecation-list)). Additionally a critical issue is drafted on the [board for the committer meeting](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/61/views/6) in at least 2 full weeks.
3. 2 weeks period: The committers comment the issue regarding which repositories are subject to **criteria 1** and **criteria 2**. Also if **Criteria 2** does not apply, deprecation may still be possible due to security concerns.
4. Committer meeting: The committers discuss the list and check the boxes in the issue. A Mail is sent out to the Eclipse Tractus-X mailing list. This list is splitted into platform products (e.g. Tractus-X EDC) and use case products (e.g. PURIS). See a template below.
5. During the [Open Planning](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/next/working-model/release-management/planning/tx-release-planning-days) the deprecation proposal is communicated again.
6. If no action is taken, during the Release of the major version, the project leads will decide for the deprecation of the given repository and communicate accordingly with the Catena-X Association's release management or the specific organization responsible for the repository.
7. In case the repository got deprecated, and there is again maintainace or develop capacity, the following procedure **MUST** be followed [Repository Reactivation Process] by a committer.

### Issue Template for Deprecation List

``` markdown
# Deprecation List

The following repositories fulfill at least **criteria 1** so that deprectation has been proposed with this issue following [TRG 7.09](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-09).

Dear @eclipse-tractusx/automotive-tractusx-committers walk through the following list and comment which of the repositories shall be checked. The list will be walked through as a critical topic in the committer meeting in two weeks.

- [ ] sample repo link 1
- [ ] sample repo link 2
```

### Mail Template for Deprecation

``` markdown
Dear Tractus-X Community,

Following repositories are proposed to be subject to deprecation with the upcoming release following [TRG 7.09](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-09).

**Platform Products (CRITICAL)**:
- link to repository 1

**Use Case Products**:
- link to repository 2

**Call to Action**: Please discuss within your company e.g., with your central Catena-X responsibles, whether you run into an issue. We highly encourage the companies to at least find resources for the **Platform Products** to maintain an open-source data space.
```

## Reactivation Guidelines

Your repository got deprecated? No worries, follow the following steps to get it back on its feet:

### Repository Reactivation Criteria

In case a repository you are maintaining or want to maintain got deprecated after all the [Criteria for Deprecation](#criteria-for-deprecation) are fulfilled, and the [Deprecation Process](#deprecation-process) finalized, the following criteria **MUST** be fulfilled to reactivate your repository:

1. The committer and requestor has capacity to resolve the security vulnerabilities and assure that the repository will comply to the latest TRGs.
2. Capacity to maintain the repository is available.
3. A solid reason is provided to reactivate the repository.

### Repository Reactivation Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[1: Requestor creates an issue in the sig-infra repository following a template] --> B[2: Requestors sendd an email to the tractusx-dev mailing list informing of reponsible committer, issue id and reason for reactivation]
    B --> C[3: Requestor informs the community in the office hour] 
    C --> D{Reactivation Criteria Fulfilled?}
    D --> |NO| E[4: Project Lead closes the issue in Github]
    D --> |YES| F[4: Project Lead opens issue in .eclipsefdn]
    F --> G[5:Once reactivated, the Project Lead announces it in the mailing list]
    G --> H[6: The Issue in sig-infra is closed]
```

1. The requestor **MUST** create an issue in the [sig-infra](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra) repository following the template [below](#issue-template-for-reactivation).
2. The requestor **MUST** announce the repository reactivation proposal via an email to the [tractusx-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) mailing list mentioning the `issueId`, the `reason/motivation`. A`responsible committer` **MUST** be announced.
3. The requestor **MUST** inform the community within the Office Hour about the petition.
4. A project lead will open a issue at the [.eclipsefdn](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/.eclipsefdn) requesting the reactivation of the repository.
5. Once the respository is reactivated, the project lead sends a mail to the [tractusx-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/tractusx-dev) mailing list announcing the reactivation.
6. The project lead closes the issue in [sig-infra](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra).

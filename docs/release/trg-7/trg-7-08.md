## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0). For non-code artifacts the default license is the [CC-BY-4.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html).

The legal obligations of the content must be observed in all forms of which the content is available.

For specifically defined KIT documentation files the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license is required.

All products delivered by the project - including websites, documentation, and help must include certain notices. Documentation might include a notice in either the pre- or post-amble, or a website might provide this information in a common footer, or a dedicated page. (From: [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-end-user))

## Description

The CC-BY-4.0 is the default license for non-code artifacts. For some documentation it may makes sense to put it under the APACHE-2.0 license, especially for technical documentation with code snippets embedded. There are special cases for the KIT documentation, that must be licensed under the CC-BY-4.:

- page_adoption_view.md(x)

Self-created images embedded in the listed KIT documentation files under the CC-BY-4.0, have also to be licensed under the CC-BY-4.0.  Generally images should go under the CC-BY-4.0.

## How to include legal notices

See also the [human-readable summary of the CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Documentation

Add a `NOTICE` section (post or preamble) into your dedicated documentation file, with the following information, here in md format:

```text
## NOTICE

This work is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 202x {Owner}
- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_doc_or_doc_dir> (*)
- Images: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_image_or_image_dir> (**)
 ```

 (*) URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable
 (**) Only, if you include self created images, see below

 See [here](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-07#documentation) how to handle multiple copyright owners.

### Self-created images

Self-created images should have the copyright and license information included, where ever possible. Images should go under the CC-BY-4.0.

Example:

```text
COPYRIGHT(C) 202x {owner}[ and others] | THIS WORK IS LICENSED UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL LICENSE (CC BY 4.0)
```

If images (and other formats) cannot be edited, there is a workaround to provide the license and copyright information. Create a new file with the same name and the `.license` postfix next to the image with the following content:

```text
This work is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 202x {owner}[ and others]
- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_image_or_image_dir> (*)
 ```

 (*) URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable

**Example:**

```shell
project/
|__ docs/
|   |__ adoption-view.md
|   |__ img/
|      |__ image1.jpg
|      |__ image1.jpg.license
|      |__ image2.png
|      |__ image2.png.license
|__ LICENSE
|__ LICENSE_non-code
```

This is the recommended way of [REUSE Software](https://reuse.software/tutorial/).

If the images are not located in the same directory as the documentation, the notice section has to be extended for the information.
Several lines for different locations can be added.

```text
- Images: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>/<link_to_image_or_image_dir> (*)
 ```

 (*) URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable

## Why

Eclipse Tractus-X is an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0). The legal obligations of the content must be observed in all forms of which the content is available.

For specifically defined KIT documentation files the secondary license [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) is required.

All products delivered by the projectâ€”including websites, documentation, and help must include certain notices. Documentation might include a notice in either the pre- or post-amble, or a website might provide this information in a common footer, or a dedicated page. (From: [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-end-user))

## Description

In Eclipse Tractus-X the primary outbound license is Apache-2.0 for code repositories, so this is the default license.

For specifically defined KIT documentation files the CC-BY-4.0 license is required, these are:

- page_adoption_view.md(x)

Self-created images embedded in the listed KIT documentation files under the CC-BY-4.0, have also to be licensed under the CC-BY-4.0.

## Location of the license

If you use the CC-BY-4.0 license as "second" license, you have to put it to the `LICENSES/' directory. <br/>

- Naming: `CC-BY-4.0.txt`
- Content: [CC-BY-4.0 plaintext](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt)

More information in [TRG 7.07](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-07#location-of-the-license).

## How to include legal notices

See also the [human-readable summary of the CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Documentation for KITs

Add a `NOTICE` section (post or preamble) into your dedicated documentation file, with the following information, here in md format:

```text
## NOTICE

This work is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 202x,202y <MyCompany>
- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>
 ```

 See [here](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-07#documentation) how to handle multiple copyright owners.

### Self-created images

As images (and other formats) cannot be edited, there is a workaround to provide the license and copyright information. For images under the CC-BY-4.0 license, create a new file with the same name and the `.license` postfix next to the image with the following content:

```text
This work is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 202x,202y <MyCompany>
- Source URL: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/<myrepo>
 ```

**Example:**

```shell
project/
|__ docs/
|   |__ adoption-view.md
|       |__ img/
|           |__ image1.jpg
|           |__ image1.jpg.license
|           |__ image2.png
|           |__ image2.png.license
|__ LICENSE
|__ LICENSES/
|   |__ CC-BY-4.0.txt
| ...
```

The legal obligations of the content must be observed in all forms of which the content is available.

This page contains information about legal documentation requirements in your repositories. The source of truth is always the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc).

:::info

The requirements described here **must** be met for each contribution.

:::

## Description

The following files must be part of your repository root folder:

- LICENSE
- LICENSE_non-code
- NOTICE.md
- SECURITY.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

The following file **must** be present on root level for every released version but can be omitted in the main branch
if appropriate actions are taken:

- [DEPENDENCIES](#dependencies-file)

For examples look to the [Eclipse Tractus-X GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx), e.g. the [sig-infra](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra).

### LICENSE FILES

The Tractus-X project uses the following licenses:

- Apache-2.0 for code
- CC-BY-4.0 for non-code

Both licenses have to be put on root level of each repository, [exampel](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra).

**Exception:** Repositories that use ONLY the CC-BY-4.0 license, e.g. [sldt-semantic-models](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/blob/main/NOTICE.md).
In these repositories the CC-BY-4.0 license in the only license and the file is named LICENSE.

See the [Handbook#legaldoc-license](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-license).

#### LICENSE FILE

In Eclipse Tractus-X the outbound license for code is Apache-2.0.

- File name: LICENSE
- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
- [License Text](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

#### LICENSE_non-code FILE

The default license for non-code is the CC-BY-4.0.

- File name: LICENSE_non-code
- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
- [License Text](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt)

For more information, see [TRG 7.08](trg-7-08.md).

### NOTICE FILE

Do the following changes:

- Add both licenses to the "Declared Project Licenses" sections, see [example](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra/blob/main/NOTICE.md)
- Add the link to your repository
- Add the link(s) to your SBOM, e.g. the DEPENDENCIES file (one or more)
- Add information for third party content checks, if not covered by the Dash Tool (e.g. IP checks for icons, fonts, ...)

[Further information](trg-7-04.md#checking-other-content-fonts-images-) and see the [Handbook#legaldoc-notice](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc-notice).

### DEPENDENCIES FILE

:::info

Third-party dependencies need to be checked regularly to reflect your code changes. The DEPENDENCIES file must be updated
accordingly. This is recommended for every contribution (e.g. PR).

:::

- Create it with the [Eclipse Dash License Tool](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-license-tool)

If different technologies / package managers (e.g. npm and maven) are used you are free to have several dependencies files.
Use the naming convention `DEPENDENCIES_XYZ`, e.g. `DEPENDENCIES_FRONTEND` and `DEPENDENCIES_BACKEND`.

These files can be kept either checked in the git repository or published to a static location (e.g. GitHub Pages) and
linked in the [NOTICE file](#notice-file).
It is advisable to run the check after every commit or during the nightly, surely it is mandatory to run it before the
release, ensuring that no `rejected` or `restricted` dependencies are being part of delivered artifacts.

[Further information](trg-7-04.md)

### SECURITY FILE

The security file contain the information, where/how to report a vulnerability issue.
See the [Handbook#vulnerability](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability) and this [example](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

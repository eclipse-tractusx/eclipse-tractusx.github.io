#### Copyright Header

Copyright (c) 202x,20yy {owner}[ and others]

Examples:

1. Copyright (c) 2021,2023 MyCompany GmbH
    - 2021, 2023 means from 2021 to 2023
    - Copyright: MyCompany GmbH
1. Copyright (c) 2021,2023 MyCompany GmbH and others
    - others: somebody has made minor changes (e.g. fixed typos)

Do **not** remove the general line "Copyright (c) 202x,20yy Contributors to the Eclipse Foundation".

#### License Header

Never change the license section, except for the formatting characters for the appropriate language.

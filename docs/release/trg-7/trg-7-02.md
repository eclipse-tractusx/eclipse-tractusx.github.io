The requirements described here **must** be met for each contribution.

## Description

*Where possible, all source code, property files, and metadata files (including application, test, and generated source code as well as other types of files such as XML, HTML, etc.) should contain appropriate copyright and license notices as well as information on each contribution.* (From the [Handbook#ip-copyright-headers](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-copyright-headers))

## Copyright and License Header

### Copyright Header

It is recommended to use the generic copyright header:

```md
Copyright (c) {year} Contributors to the Eclipse Foundation
 ```

**Note:**

- The **year** is the year of the initial creation.
- The contributors are identified via the GitHub commit logs (see NOTICE file)

Additionally copyright lines can be added (one or more times) to list specific copyright owner(s):

```md
Copyright (c) 202x {owner}[ and others]
 ```

**Examples:**

1. Copyright (c) 2021 Jane Doe
    - Copyright: Jane Doe
1. Copyright (c) 2022 Jane Doe and others
    - others: somebody has made minor changes (e.g. fixed typos)

Do **not** remove the general line "Copyright (c) 202x Contributors to the Eclipse Foundation".

### License Header

Never change the license section, except for the comment characters for the appropriate language.

#### Example for Apache-2.0 (Java)

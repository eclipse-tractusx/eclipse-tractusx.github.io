## Why

This TRG serves to maintain a **consistent structure** and ensure **content quality** for the KIT developers.

Here is described the graduation process for KITs that have met the required criteria and are ready to move from incubating to graduated status. For more information about the complete KIT lifecycle, please see the [TRG 10.03 - KIT Lifecycle](./trg-10-03.mdx) documentation.

## General Requirements

- A KIT can achieve graduation if it fulfills the required artifacts and passes the graduation process - see [TRG 10.03 - KIT Lifecycle](./trg-10-03.mdx)
- A KIT in order to achieve graduation must go through the graduation process described below.
- A KIT in order to be graduated must have at least one CODEOWNERS (must be a Eclipse Committer) assigned for maintenance and support, more details about code owners can be found at [TRG 10.02 - KIT Content Structure](./trg-10-02.mdx)

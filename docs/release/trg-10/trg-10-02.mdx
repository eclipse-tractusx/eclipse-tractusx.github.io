| Status     | Created      | Post-History                           |
|------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Draft      | 12-Apr-2024  | Initial contribution                   |
| Active     | 20-Nov-2025  | Splitted 09.01 Draft into 10.01, 10.02, 10.03 adding the new KIT 2.0 Content Structure |

## Why

This TRG serves to maintain a **consistent structure** and ensure **content quality** for the KIT developers, including details for KIT content structure and KIT content owners/maintainers.

**KIT**, short for **Keep It Together**, is an open-source toolbox with comprehensive documentation that enables multiple stakeholders **(Business, Solution Providers, Developers)** to build interoperable applications compatible with the Eclipse Tractus-X dataspace technologies, and support the compliance with industrial standards from standarization organizations (Catena-X e.V., IDTA, ISO/DIN, EDWG, Manufacturing-X, etc.) and in some cases enable regulatory compliance.

A detailed explanation can be found here:
[KIT Framework](../../../documentation/kit-framework)

## General Requirements

- A KIT must have a <code>changelog.md</code> following semantic versioning + the release date of Tractus-X - see [TRG 1.03 - CHANGELOG.md](/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-03)
- A KIT must have, at minimum, an adoption view (Sandbox stage) - see [KIT Lifecycle Levels](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/documentation/kit-lifecycle)
- KIT artifacts must be structured according to the respective views (i.e. adoption, development, operations) - see [KIT Artifacts](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/documentation/kit-framework)
- Linked documents (e.g., Catena-X standards, Whitepapers) must include the current valid version (e.g. Business Partner Number (Version 2.0.0))
- Each KIT view (business, development, ..) must include a license notice and adhere to the CY BB 4.0 license - see [TRG 7.08 - Legal notice for KIT documentation (CC-BY-4.0)](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-08)
- Images must be neutral without any branding, and displayed on a. Images need to follow a the legal notice TRG - see [Legal notice for non-code](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-07)
- A KIT must have a defined code owner for each industry extension - see [Industry Extensions](#industry-extensions)
- A KIT must have defined code owners for kit maintenance - see [KIT Maintainers & Code Owners](#kit-maintainers--code-owners)

## Description

:::info Generic Requirements for All KITs
In addition to the view-specific content below, every KIT must include:
- **Copyright Notice** - Mandatory CC-BY-4.0 licensing information and contributor copyright statements at every file
- **Changelog** - Version history file following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)

The views below are organized in "folders" so that its sections are harmonized and the content from each view remains flexible.
:::
<KitStructureTable />


A deep dive extension of each section can be found at the [KIT Framework Documentation](../../../documentation/kit-framework) guideline.


## KIT Maintainers & Code Owners

- A code owner must be set by adding to the `CODEOWNERS` at the folder path, the file is located here [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).

The `CODEOWNERS` file must follow the structure described at the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

No company/organization can be added as a code owner, only a contributor with a GitHub account. Ownership and Copyright for organizations are described in the following [TRG 7.08 - Legal notice for KIT documentation (CC-BY-4.0)](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-08)

Example:


```plaintext
# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs-kits/kits/connector-kit/`
# directory, it will be notified of any changes to files in that directory, if he is a committer.
# subdirectories.
/docs-kits/kits/connector-kit/ @doctocat
```

### Industry Extensions

The following rules apply for the industry extension section:

- Only releavant/updated content for the specific industry extension should be included, in case legacy content is needed, the content can be kept previous versions of the KIT or archived at the [large-files repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io.largefiles).
- A code owner must be set by adding to the `CODEOWNERS` at the specific industry extension folder path, the file is located here [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).

The `CODEOWNERS` file must follow the structure described at the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

No company/organization can be added as a code owner, only a contributor with a GitHub account. Ownership and Copyright for organizations are described in the following [TRG 7.08 - Legal notice for KIT documentation (CC-BY-4.0)](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-08)


Example:


```plaintext
# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs-kits/kits/connector-kit/industry-extensions/automotive`
# directory, it will be notified of any changes to files in that directory, if he is a committer.
# subdirectories.
/docs-kits/kits/connector-kit/industry-extensions/automotive/ @doctocat
```

When a change is done to the industry extension folder, please contact the code owner via the available channels (Matrix Chat, Mailing List, etc.) to inform them about the change.

## Alignment Mechanisms

To ensure the quality and consistency of KITs, the following alignment mechanisms are in place, not all channels need to be activated:

### Main KIT Alignment Channels:

| Channel | Purpose | Link |
|---------|---------|------|
| Alignment Day | Quarterly refinement sessions | [Alignment Days Docs](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/release-process#alignment-day) |

## Why

Test automation is essential for maintaining high-quality software in complex environments. It improves reliability by
detecting issues early, ensures consistency across projects, and reduces the effort of
repetitive manual testing. Automated testing provides faster feedback, enabling developers to address problems promptly.
This guideline focuses on API tests at the integration test level (end-to-end) and may also cover UI tests at the
integration test level.

## Description

### 1. Test Case Creation

#### 1.1. **Gherkin Syntax**

- Test cases should be written using **Gherkin syntax** in `.feature` files.
- Features should be expressed in a **domain-specific language (DSL)** for clarity and consistency.

#### 1.2. **Feature File Structure**

- Features should include:
  - A clear and concise title.
  - Background sections for shared setup steps.
  - Scenarios written in the Given-When-Then format.

### 2. Test Implementation

#### 2.1. **Cucumber with Maven**

- Use **Cucumber** in combination with **Maven** to generate test classes and implement them in a structured manner.
- Ensure modular and reusable test step implementations.

#### 2.2. **API Test Focus**

- Prioritize API tests at the integration test level to validate end-to-end functionality.
- Optionally include UI tests at the integration level if applicable.

### 3. Automation and Integration

#### 3.1. **GitHub Actions**

- Integrate test execution into **GitHub Actions** workflows for automated testing.
- Trigger tests on key events such as pull requests and merges to main branches.

#### 3.2. **Test Reporting**

- Generate and store detailed test reports as part of the CI/CD pipeline outputs.
- Provide clear pass/fail results for stakeholders.

### 4. Examples and Resources

#### 4.1. **Code Examples**

An example of such GitHub workflow can be found below.

```yaml
name: Run Cucumber Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  run-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up Java
    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'

    # Step 3: Cache Maven dependencies
    - name: Cache Maven dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.m2/repository
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-maven-

    # Step 4: Run Maven tests
    - name: Run Cucumber tests
      run: mvn clean test

    # Step 5: Upload test results
    - name: Archive test results
      if: always()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: cucumber-test-results
        path: target/surefire-reports/

```

#### 4.2. **Future Scope (Optional)**

- Explore importing test run results into Jira Xray or similar test management systems (not considered part of the
  current TRG due to Open Source constraints).

---

## Documentation

All test automation configurations should be stored in the project repository. Test results should be uploaded
to the execution workflow as an attachment. See [code-examples](#41-code-examples).

---

## Compliance

This TRG serves as a recommendation. While product teams may adopt other frameworks or tools, the use of Cucumber as a
standard is encouraged for consistency and best practices.

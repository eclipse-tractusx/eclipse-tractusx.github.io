## Why

With using helm charts, the upgrade of an application also happens through an upgrade of the helm chart. The application handles the upgrade itself like executing a database upgrade. The upgrade of the helm chart itself also needs to be tested and by testing the helm upgrade, you automatically verify that the application upgrade works too.

## Description

Based on the [Helm test](trg-5-09.md) workflow, you **must** provide a GitHub action which takes the latest released helm chart, does an installation of it and then execute the upgrade to the current / new version.

To do so you **must** provide a GitHub action which runs helm install of the last released version and than a helm upgrade of the version to be released and than execute a helm test.

The **GitHub Action** needs to be able to be **triggered manually**.

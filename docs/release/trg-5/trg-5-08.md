## Why

Having a single source for Helm chart makes it easier to test and deploy the product and reduces the complexity of installing backend/frontend/utility applications separately.

## Description

A "Product Helm Chart" is a released helm chart that contains all the components of a product **ready to deploy**. This can either be achieved by **creating a single Helm chart** for the product or by **combining the Helm charts** of the different components into a single chart using dependencies.

## Product Helm Chart rules

- name of the Chart **should** be just the `product-name` without prefix or suffix (similar to the [leading product repository](../trg-2/trg-2-4))
- values file **should** contain all available variables (even from subcharts) with default values and comments about what they do
- [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/#helm-install) command should successfully install the chart to any supported Kubernetes version cluster (without overwriting default values)
- [helm test](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_test/) runs without errors (see [TRG 5.09 - Helm test](trg-5-09.md))
- create a single helm chart for the whole product or combine charts into a single one using [dependencies](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/#helm-dependency) feature

## Why

Correct versioning is crucial when testing and deploying the application. It helps to identify issues with the chart or
the application image. Upgrading or rolling back of the deployment would lead to problems without proper versioning.

For more details, see the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#charts-and-versioning)

## Description

There are two different version properties for a Helm chart:

- Chart version
- App version

### Chart version

It is located in the `Chart.yaml` under the `version` property.
It requires **semantic versioning** format.
The **Chart version has to be increased** every time one of the following file is changed:

- `Chart.yaml`
- `values.yaml`
- templates directory

### App version

The default app version value is located in the `Chart.yaml` file under the **appVersion** property. Any format can be
used, but the appVersion and the image tag of your docker images should be aligned. This means, the appVersion should be
used in the templates as the **default image tag** for the deployment/pod. Every time the appVersion property is
upgraded the **chart version** number has to be increased as well.

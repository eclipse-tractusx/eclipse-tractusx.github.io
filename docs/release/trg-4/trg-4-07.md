## Why

The read-only root filesystem right can limit the impact of container compromise when set properly.
This can prevent malicious processes or applications from writing back to the host file system.
Such a setting can be an extra protection layer to prevent an attack.

## Description

The read-only filesystem configuration is defined in the deployment yaml. The security context parameters are assigned to the pod.
This ensures that unprivileged access cannot be abused to install malicious software of write to the file system. This control is by default false.
Therefore it is to be considered for each deployment if the flag can be set to the recommended value "true". Only read in this case.

### Implementation

The container's **Pod resource file (yaml)** has to be modified to set rights to read-only.

Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: read-only
spec:
  containers:
    ...
      # The [container security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container) defines privilege and access control settings for a Container within a pod
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
             # -- Specifies which capabilities to drop to reduce syscall attack surface
            drop:
            - ALL
            # -- Specifies which capabilities to add to issue specialized syscalls
            add: []
          # -- Whether the root filesystem is mounted in read-only mode
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          # -- Controls [Privilege Escalation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/#privilege-escalation) enabling setuid binaries changing the effective user ID
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          # -- Requires the container to run without root privileges
          runAsNonRoot: true
          # -- The container's process will run with the specified uid
          runAsUser: 10001
```

In some cases you might encounter the issue that tmp cannot be overwritten:

```log
[emerg] 1#1: mkdir() "/tmp/proxy_temp" failed (30: Read-only file system)
nginx: [emerg] mkdir() "/tmp/proxy_temp" failed (30: Read-only file system)
```

To fix this you need to make tmp writeable and mount /tmp to emptyDir.

```yaml
      spec:
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 999
        containers:
        - image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:latest
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: nginx
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080 //ONLY open ports that are necessary to run
            protocol: TCP
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              drop:
                - NET_RAW //ONLY required if your containers have NET_RAW capability
            runAsNonRoot: true
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          resources: //Set proper limits for your container
              .
              .
              .
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /tmp
            name: tmp
        volumes:
        - emptyDir: {}
          name: tmp
```

### Temporary Folders (If needed)

A temporary filesystem (tmpfs) works similar like a regular volume. Everything written to this filesystem will be removed when the container gets terminated.
In the case that an executable in your container should need a temporary folder for logging or spooling purposes, you can mount a writable emptydir volume as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: temporary-folder
spec:
  containers:
    - name: sample-container-which-needs-temporary-folder
      image: your-image
      securityContext:
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      volumeMounts:
        - name: tempfolder
          mountPath: /tmp
          readOnly: false
  volumes:
    - name: tempfolder
      emptyDir: {}
```

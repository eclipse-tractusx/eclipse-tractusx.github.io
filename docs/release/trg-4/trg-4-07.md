## Why

The read-only root filesystem right can limit the impact of container compromise when set properly.
This can prevent malicous processes or applications from writing back to the host file system.
Such a setting can be an extra protection layer to prevent an attack.

## Description

The read-only filesystem configuration is defined in the deployment yaml. The security context parameters are assigned to the pod.
This ensures that unpriviledged access cannot be abused to install malicous software of write to the file system. This control is by default false.
Therefore it is to be considered for each deployment if the flag can be set to the recommended value "true". Only read in this case.

### Implementation

The container's **Pod resource file (yaml)** has to be modified to set rights to read-only.

Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: read-only
spec:  
  containers:  

  securityContext:  
    #read-only and prevent writing to the root file system
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

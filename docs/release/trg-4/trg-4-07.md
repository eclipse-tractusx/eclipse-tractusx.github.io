## Why

A read-only root filesystem helps to limit the impact of a compromised container on a Kubernetes node. It is recommended to utilize read-only filesystems when possible. This prevents a malicious process or application from writing back to the host system. Read-only filesystems are a key component to preventing container breakout.

## Description

Whether this container has a read-only root filesystem. Default is false.

### Implementation

The container's **Pod resource file (yaml)** has to be modified to set rights to read-only.

Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: read-only-fs
spec:  
  containers:  

  securityContext:  
    #read-only fs explicitly defined
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

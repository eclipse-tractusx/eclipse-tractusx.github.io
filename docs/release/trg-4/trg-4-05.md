## Why

Using a central container registry greatly improves security and manageability of images. It also makes it easier for external parties to validate that images are correct if they are coming from the same source.

## Description

In Eclipse Tractus-X we are using one central container registry. This registry ist [tractusx on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tractusx).

All container images released for an Eclipse Tractus-X product **must** be present on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tractusx).
Also be aware of the necessary remarks for container images described in [TRG 4-06](./trg-4-06.md) and alignment on common base images
described in [TRG 4.02](./trg-4-02.md).

## Implementation

The example from [TRG 4.01](./trg-4-01.md) shows a simple workflow, that can be used to publish your Docker image(s) to `DockerHub`.
It is using secrets, that contain credentials to authenticate at `DockerHub`. These secrets are present at GitHub organization
level and can therefore be used in any repository in our org.

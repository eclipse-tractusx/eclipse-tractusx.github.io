## Why

Normally containers do not need root permission but if a container image runs as root, a compromised container has potentially root permissions on the underlying node.

For security reasons this is **must** be followed.

## Description

### Implementation

The container's **Dockerfile** and the **Pod resource file (yaml)** has to be modified to be able to run as a non-root user.

- First it is recommended to check how the base image is built to see if it
  might already have a non-root user defined and used. In this case it is enough
  to specify that user in the Dockerfile with the `USER` instruction.
- Otherwise modify the image's Dockerfile with a `RUN` command that adds a non-root user
  and a `USER` command that specifies which user runs the container on startup.
  The example below can be modified for specific needs/requirements.

```Dockerfile
#Pull the base image as Ubuntu
FROM ubuntu:latest

#Add a user with userid 1000 and name nonroot
RUN useradd âˆ’u 1000 nonroot

#Run Container as nonroot
USER nonroot
```

- Modify the [Pod's or Deployment's configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container) by adding `runAsUser` field for both the pod's and container's securityContext section. Also set the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` to `false` on the container's securityContext. See the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000 # SPECIFY USER ID HERE
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false # SET THIS TO FALSE
```

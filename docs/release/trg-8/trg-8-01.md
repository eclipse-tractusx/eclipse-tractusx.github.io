## Why

Use CodeQL for deep, static code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and improve code quality across a wide range of programming languages.

## Description

Use CodeQL for all repos with classic code (e.g., C#, Java) without exception. Do not use it for documentation-only or pure IaC repos; it's intended solely for analyzing classic code vulnerabilities. Exclude files as necessary.

The GitHub Actions configuration must include the following triggers:

- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual workflow execution.
- `schedule`: Schedule the workflow to run at least once a week with `0 0 * * 0`.
- `push` and `pull_request`: Activate the workflow on both push and pull request events targeting the branch that contains the code for the currently supported version, which may not necessarily be the `main` branch. This is the branch from which new releases will be made.

Findings appear in the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard. Dismiss high/error findings as non-exploitable or false positives with required justification in the vulnerability alert.

:::caution

Address high severity findings; it is recommended to also address medium severity findings.

:::

You can tailor the failure conditions (`fail-on`) for high severity issues in the workflow to suit your team's preferences.

Adjust your code's language and build settings as indicated within the workflow comments.

Example CodeQL workflow:

```yml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths-ignore:
      - "**/*.md"
      - "**/*.txt"
  pull_request:
    # The branches below must be a subset of the branches above
    branches: ["main"]
    paths-ignore:
      - "**/*.md"
      - "**/*.txt"
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 360
    permissions:
      actions: read

      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: ["java"] # Define languages here
        # CodeQL supports [ 'cpp', 'csharp', 'go', 'java', 'javascript', 'python', 'ruby', 'swift' ]
        # Use only 'java' to analyze code written in Java, Kotlin or both
        # Use only 'javascript' to analyze code written in JavaScript, TypeScript or both

          # By default, queries listed here will override any specified in a config file
          # Prefix the list here with "+" to use these queries and those in the config file

          # For more details on CodeQL's query packs, refer to: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs

      # Autobuild attempts to build any compiled languages (C/C++, C#, Go, Java, or Swift)
      # Automates dependency installation for Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, optimizing the CodeQL analysis setup
      # If this step fails, then you should remove it and run the build manually (see below)

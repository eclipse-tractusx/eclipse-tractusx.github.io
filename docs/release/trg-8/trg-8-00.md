## Why

Our primary aim is to improve security and define best practices across the Tractus-X ecosystem.

## Description

A security scanning toolchain is a collection of tools and processes that are used to scan software applications for security vulnerabilities. These tools can be used at various stages of the software development lifecycle (**SDLC**), from development to deployment and beyond.

:::caution

To pass the quality gates, all **critical** and **high** security vulnerabilities **must be mitigated**.

## Tools that weâ€™re using

- ### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Tools analyze source code or compiled binaries to identify potential vulnerabilities

**Open-Source**: [CodeQL](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-01), [Snyk](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-06)

- ### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

Tools examine the software components

**Open-Source**: [Snyk](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-06)

- ### DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

Tools test the application in it is running state to identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by SAST

**Open-Source**: [Owasp ZAP](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-05)

- ### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

Tools that check the configuration files that define the infrastructure components of an application

**Open-Source**: [KICS](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-03), [Snyk](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-06)

- ### Secret Scanning

Tools designed to search for and identify sensitive information, known as secrets, within code repositiories

**Open-Source**: [GitGuardian](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-02)

- ### Container Scanner

Tools that scan the container images and the running containers

**Open-Source**: [Trivy](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-04), [Snyk](/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-06)

:::tip

Security is not a one-time activity, but a continuous process that requires constant attention and improvement.
Even if you cannot perform a full **security assessment** for each product every release, you should at least follow basic security practices.

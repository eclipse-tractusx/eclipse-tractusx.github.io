## Why

Trivy scans our Docker containers to accurately identify and remediate vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies, ensuring our environment remains secure.

## Description

Trivy should be used if your project or repository builds containers and publishes them to Docker Hub.

Configure your GitHub Actions to include:

- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual workflow execution.
- `schedule`: Schedule the workflow to run at least once a week with `0 0 * * 0`.

Because Trivy scans the published image on Docker Hub, running it on a `schedule` suffices, removing the necessity to execute it on every push and pull request. Optionally, the local build in the pipeline run can be scanned, using the `push` and `pull_request` triggers for these scans.

In the Trivy workflow, the Docker Hub image scanned must be the currently supported version, not necessarily the `latest` image.

If multiple Docker images, such as frontend and backend, are published from the repository, configure a scan for each image either by using the `matrix` option or by duplicating the necessary steps from the example workflow.

Findings appear in the GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard. Dismiss high/error findings as non-exploitable or false positives with required justification in the vulnerability alert.

:::caution

Address high severity findings; it is recommended to also address medium severity findings.

Due to IP considerations, base images with findings must not be updated arbitrarily, as outlined in [TRG4](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-4/trg-4-02).

:::

You can tailor the failure conditions (`exit-code`, `severity`) for high severity issues in the workflow to suit your team's preferences.

Example Trivy workflow:

```yml
name: "Trivy"

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"
  workflow_dispatch:


jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    steps:
      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.18.0
        with:
          image-ref: "tractusx/<your-image>:<version>" # Pull image from Docker Hub and run Trivy vulnerability scanner
          format: "sarif"
          output: "trivy-results.sarif"
          exit-code: "1" # Trivy exits with code 1 if vulnerabilities are found, causing the workflow step to fail.
          severity: "CRITICAL,HIGH" # While vulnerabilities of all severities are reported in the SARIF output, the exit code and workflow failure are triggered only by these specified severities (CRITICAL or HIGH).
          hide-progress: false

      - name: Upload Trivy scan results to GitHub Security tab
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: "trivy-results.sarif"
```

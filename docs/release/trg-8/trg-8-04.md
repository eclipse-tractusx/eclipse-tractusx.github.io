## Description

**GitGuardian** is integrated via its GitHub App, enabling automated secret scanning of our codebase. Each pull request (PR) undergoes a scan. If a potential secret is detected, the commit's author receives an immediate email notification.

:::info

The email contains a temporary **link**, allowing the author to either **report** the detected secret or **mark it as a false positive**, streamlining the review process for software engineers.

Thus the Data Plane is the only entry/output door for the data, which avoids the provider to exposedirectly its data externally.The Data Plane public API being a proxy, it supports all verbs (i.e. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), whichcan then conveyed until the data source is required. This is especially useful when the actual data sourceis a Rest API itself.In the same manner, any set of arbitrary query parameters, path parameters and request body are supported (in the limits fixed by the HTTP server) and can also conveyed to the actual data source."}],"paths":{"/token":{"get":{"tags":["Consumer Pull Token Validation"],"description":"Checks that the provided token has been signed by the present entity and asserts its validity.

Identifier types such as BPN or VAT determine with which kind of values a business partner can be identified with. The actual name of the identifier type is free to choose and doesn''t need to be unique. The technical key can be freely chosen but needs to be unique for the businessPartnerType as it is used as reference by the business partner records. A recommendation for technical keys: They should be short, descriptive and use a restricted common character set in order to ensure compatibility with older systems.'

In general, an address is a collection of information to describe a physical location, using a street name with a house number and/or a post office box as reference. In addition, an address consists of several postal attributes, such as country, region (state), county, township, city, district, or postal code, which help deliver mail.In Catena-X, an address is a type of business partner representing the legal address of a legal entity, and/or the main address of a site, or any additional address of a legal entity or site (such as different gates).An address is owned by a legal entity.

In general, a site is a delimited geographical area in which an organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc.) conducts business. In Catena-X, a site is a type of business partner representing a physical location or area owned by a legal entity, where a production plant, a warehouse, or an office building is located. A site is owned by a legal entity. Thus, exactly one legal entity is assigned to a site. A site has exactly one main address, but it is possible to specify additional addresses (such as different gates), that belong to a site. Thus, at least one address is assigned to a site. A site can only be uploaded and modified by the owner (the legal entity), because only the owner knows which addresses belong to which site. A site is uniquely identified by the BPNS.

      description: Created/updated business partner of type site. In general, a site is a delimited geographical area in which an organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc.) conducts business. In Catena-X, a site is a type of business partner representing a physical location or area owned by a legal entity, where a production plant, a warehouse, or an office building is located. A site is owned by a legal entity. Thus, exactly one legal entity is assigned to a site. A site has exactly one main address, but it is possible to specify additional addresses (such as different gates), that belong to a site. Thus, at least one address is assigned to a site. A site can only be uploaded and modified by the owner (the legal entity), because only the owner knows which addresses belong to which site. A site is uniquely identified by the BPNS.

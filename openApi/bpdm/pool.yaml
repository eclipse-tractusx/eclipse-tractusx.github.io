A site is owned by a legal entity. Thus, exactly one legal entity is assigned to a site. A site has exactly one main address, but it is possible to specify additional addresses (such as different gates), that belong to a site. Thus, at least one address is assigned to a site. A site can only be uploaded and modified by the owner (the legal entity), because only the owner knows which addresses belong to which site. A site is uniquely identified by the BPNS.

Identifier types such as BPN or VAT determine with which kind of values a business partner can be identified with.

The technical key can be freely chosen but needs to be unique for the businessPartnerType as it is used as reference by the business partner records.

The term especially applies to any kind of organization (such as an enterprise or company, university, association, etc.) established under the law applicable to a country.In Catena-X, a legal entity is a type of business partner representing a legally registered organization with its official registration information, such as legal name (including legal form, if registered), legal address and tax number.A legal entity has exactly one legal address, but it is possible to specify additional addresses that a legal entity owns. Thus, at least one address is assigned to a legal entity. A legal entity can own sites. Thus, many or no sites are assigned to a legal entity. A legal entity is uniquely identified by the BPNL.

## Office Hour meeting minutes

### System team

- Number of previous KIT versions of the home page have been [reduced](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/pull/840). (this speeds up the compile process by 3,5x)
- System team is working on collecting the OpenAPI specs (as alternative to SwaggerHub)


### Security team

- Invicti [DAST](https://www.invicti.com/learn/dynamic-application-security-testing-dast/) scans are available now. They are not part of the next QG.
- Heads up regarding the *XZ backdoor awareness mail* on the mailing list


### FOSS

- Committer elections are important to prevent hostile project takeover (especially in the wake of the [XZ Utils backdoor](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094) )

### Open planning / community

- n/a

### Discussions

- Reminder that there will be a "tandem mode" review for next QGate:
  - one reviewer from System team and one committer from the projects for each QG Check
  - the "project committer" can not review his/her one project

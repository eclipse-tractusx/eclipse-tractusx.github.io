## Office Hour meeting minutes

### System team

- Still looking for volunteers to work on QG reviews together with the system team
  - Goal is to spread knowledge on how TRGs are checked
  - Especially interesting for committers, that already know they will stay post consortia
- Preparing an open description on our release process. Feel free to comment any suggestion or important topics, you think should be covered [on this draft](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/pull/519)
- Markdown linting will again be enabled for KITs. Findings will be collected as issue per KIT
- OpenAPI plugin for docusaurus will be removed
  - OpenAPI definitions will be pushed to SwaggerHub. User credentials available as org secrets
  - Ongoing discussions: Some definitions might be published through standard and therefore out of eclipse-tractusx

### Security team

- New TRG suggestion PR: [eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io#681](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/pull/681)
- Reminder: please focus on `eclipse-tractusx` instead of `catenax-ng`
- Please reach out to the security team, as soon as the security scans for QG checks are ready for QG review

### FOSS

- Election for Jim Marino open: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx/elections/election-james-marino-committer-eclipse-tractus-x

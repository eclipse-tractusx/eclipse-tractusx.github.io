## Office Hour meeting minutes

### System team

- n/a

### Security team

- TRG [8.01](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-8-01),
  [8.03](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-8-03),
  [8.04](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-8-04),
  [8.05](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-0/trg-8-05) 
  first drafts are created, final versions will come soon
- Be patient with [CodeQL](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-security/blob/main/security-tooling.md#codeql), could be tedious since it does provide a lot of findings

### FOSS

- New [commiter election](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx/elections/election-rohan-krishnamurthy-committer-eclipse-tractus-x) is open for Rohan Krishnamurthy. Please visit the page and make your vote!

### Open planning / community

- Role of the committer is being discussed, it will be presented in the next committer meeting.
  Basic role descriptions come from the Eclipse Foundation, but we want to specify in Tractus-X
  what else can be expected from a [contributor](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php),
  [commiter](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/become_a_member/committer.php) and [project lead](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-pl).
- Association release process and Eclipse Tractus-X needs to be aligned as the first is managed by
  the association and the second should be driven by the community.

### Open Discussions

- We should align on how and where a migration documentation should be created for products.
  This would ensure that upon Breaking Changes the upgrade processes can run smoothly with
  a guide available for everyone. The guide could include property, configuration, API changes
  and everything else that would affect the upgrade process from and old version to the new.
  A draft will be available on a working model that could be implemented by the products soon.
  A TRG could include information on where these guide should be located and in which format.

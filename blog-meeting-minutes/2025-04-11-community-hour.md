### Security

- Check regularly if there are findings for vulnerabilities or dependency updates in the security tab of your project repository. 
Friendly reminder from Mathias Moser that this is a high priority for the community and the leads, and if repositories are not maintained they unfortunately would have to be deprecated.

### FOSS Governance

- Security check scans in GitHub are disabled by default after 60 days of no changes in repository. TRG update to inform about this has been suggested, issue will be kept on board until it can be merged.
- Issue regarding cleaning of archived repositories: No update, issue will be kept on board.
- [Status of Docusaurus update to version 3.x](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/61/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=106022500): 
    - Update from Stephan Bauer that already a lot of KITs have been migrated. Thanks to Philipp, Arno, Manojava who provided much of the work there.

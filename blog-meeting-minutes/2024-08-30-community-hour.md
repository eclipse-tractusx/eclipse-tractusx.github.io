## Office Hour meeting minutes

### Infrastructure

- @ds-hzimmer will continue to report from the monthly infrastructure updates that are to happen every month's last sunday.
  - product teams will have to check their deployments after that

### Security team

- Trufflehog has now officially replaced GitGuardian as secret-scanning tool for Eclipse Tractus-X. [This is encoded by TRG8.03](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-8/trg-8-03)
- @ds-hzimmer reports about the sporadic use of the current sonarcloud instance for Eclipse Tractus-X. There's no TRG for it. It's unclear what additional benefit it will bring to those tools that are backed up with TRGs (Trufflehog, trivy, codeql).

### Q&A

- @tom-rm-meyer-ISST reports issues with the tls provider which will be checked with the infrastructure team.

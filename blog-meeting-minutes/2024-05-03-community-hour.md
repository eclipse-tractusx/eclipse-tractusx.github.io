- Interoperability and Thread Modelling checks in 24.05?
  - You can approach the Security Team via issue on [sig-security](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-security)
  - Checks, that have been documented in a Consorita Confluence instance, could still take place, but a transparent format should be considered.
    Some Teams already documented on GitHub.

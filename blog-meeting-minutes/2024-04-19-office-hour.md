### Open planning / community

- New dates with blockers will be added to the website for release 24.12 soon, keep an eye on them! There will be a news entry when they are available

### Discussions

- You can read about Eclipse roles and how to become one [here](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/contributor-committer#committer)
- There is a [new board work in progress](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-tractusx/projects/61/views/1#) on GitHub that could be a replacement for the current
  Miro board we use for the Office Hour
- Kubernetes 1.30 is available now, but consortia clusters are still on 1.27 (which is the LTS 
  version). This should be aligned as [TRG5.10](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-5/trg-5-10#description) describes our goal otherwise.
- For release 24.05 you can [open an issue for security assessment](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-security/issues/new/choose) in the sig-security repository.
  This support won't be available starting with release 24.08
- There is a problem currently with the calendar files on the website for. It is
  being investigated and an update will be provided soon.

### Open discussion

- Question related to [TRG 1.04 Diagrams as code](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-1/trg-1-4), if there a need/requirement to convert already existing .png diagrams. It is recommended to use described in the TRG toolset to keep good level of maintainability of the diagrams, not a hard requirement though in case there is lack of source.

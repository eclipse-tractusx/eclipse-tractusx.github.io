## Office Hour meeting minutes

### Infrastructure Test Management

- **GNI X-Ray Test Sessions**:  
    2 sessions held; no active registrations.  
    Keep status _in progress_ for potential October session.
- **External Product Test Phase**:  
    Release Candidate 3 published by Lars & team; some issues remain.  
    Next evaluation meeting on Tuesday.  
    Confirmed: Catena-X **does not** provide dedicated dev environments — teams are responsible for their own.

### Release Management

- Release postponed; target Tuesday/Wednesday.
- **Preparation**:
    - Change logs ready for review (Teresa prepared initial version).
    - Need contributions for _Known Issues_ and _product-specific notes_ (e.g. BPDM, Connector).
- **Screenshots in Release Notes**: Discuss post-release.
- **Changelog Improvement Idea**: Block-format inspired by _Docusaurus_ for better presentation.

### Security

- Reminder: Check the security tab regularly.
- Deprecation of "Digital Product as Repository of Surveillance" planned next week.
- Plan to migrate VP visualization to _Industry Core_.

### Community & Events

- **Catena-X Community Days** (End of December): Registration open.
    - New field to list products you contributed to.
    - Multiple select option fixed.
    - Booking changes may require cancel/re-register.
- Call for workshop leaders/presenters.
- New “Community Events” room created for event promotion and discussions.

### Committer Election

- **Andrii** proposed as new committer — key contributions on EDC component, DSP/DCP TCK, release process improvements.

### General Reminders

- Moderation list update needed (René added).
- No office hour next week due to public holiday in Germany.

### GitHub Fork Access Clarification

- Forks in _private accounts_ do **not** inherit original repo’s write access.  
    Owner must explicitly grant rights.  
    Public forks: read-only access by default.

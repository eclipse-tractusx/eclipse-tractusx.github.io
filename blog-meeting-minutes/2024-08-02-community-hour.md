## Office Hour meeting minutes

### Infrastructure

- Discussion on catenax-ng
  - @matbmoser: please cross-check your own repository, if you reference it!
  - @lgblaumeiser: we noticed that the R24.03 MIW needs catenax-ng resources. It temporarily stays up. (see [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/managed-identity-wallet/issues/342))
- Consortia teams are gone. Thanks, it was a pleasure! 

### Security team

- @matbmoser: Please do check for your security issues on the tab. High and critical issues need to be fixed. We should check this on high level / project level regularly in this meeting
- @tom-rm-meyer-ISST: For Truffle Hog, make sure that the workflow runs before merging. (see [e.g.](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/puris/pull/531))

### FOSS

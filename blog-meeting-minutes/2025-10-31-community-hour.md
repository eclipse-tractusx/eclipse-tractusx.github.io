- DTR has an update ongoing, but the PR is open. New version expected on next week

## Update Release Management

- Release Check issues must be created next week to confirm who joins or opts out of the test phase; reminders have been sent to previous participants.

## Update Security

- Please patch high and critical security vulneratiblities before e2e test.

## Update Community/Open Planning

- Community Days: registration open; a lot of other data spaces have been invited.
- Container images: [@mgarciaLKS](https://github.com/mgarciaLKS) raised a TRG update for postgres with an example linked [eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io#1367](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/eclipse-tractusx.github.io/pull/1367), committers aligned on 18.x
- What's the last date to provide the semantic model? Should be in line with the Final KIT PR (25.12 = 2025-11-17)
- What needs a ticket for release and how to release a kit? If you release a KIT, you need a release ticket: [PURIS example](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-release/issues/1494) - If you release something unfinished or not released in standards, add a disclaimer.
